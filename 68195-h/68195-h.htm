<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> half-century, whose more familiar aspects
this little book is designed to illustrate, has
spread its boundary lines. Nothing is so hard
to deal with as a period. Nothing is so unmanageable
as a date. People will be born a
few years too early; they will live a few years
too long. Events will happen out of time. The
closely linked decades refuse to be separated,
and my half-century, that I thought so compact,
widened imperceptibly while I wrote.</p>

<p>I have filled my canvas with trivial things,
with intimate details, with what now seem the
insignificant aspects of life. But the insignificant
aspects of life concern us mightily while
we live; and it is by their help that we understand
the insignificant people who are sometimes
reckoned of importance. A hundred
years ago many men and women were reckoned
of importance, at whose claims their successors
to-day smile scornfully. Yet they and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
work were woven into the tissue of things, into
the warp and woof of social conditions, into
the literary history of England. An hour is
not too precious to waste upon them, however
feeble their pretensions. Perhaps some idle
reader in the future will do as much by us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A HAPPY HALF-CENTURY</h2>
</div>



<p class="center">This damn’d unmasculine canting age!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="indentleft"><span class="smcap">Charles Lamb.</span></span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few of us who do not occasionally
wish we had been born in other days, in days
for which we have some secret affinity, and
which shine for us with a mellow light in the
deceitful pages of history. Mr. Austin Dobson,
for example, must have sighed more than once
to see Queen Anne on Queen Victoria’s throne;
and the Rt. Hon. Cecil Rhodes must have realized
that the reign of Elizabeth was the reign
for him. There is a great deal lost in being
born out of date. What freak of fortune thrust
Galileo into the world three centuries too soon,
and held back Richard Burton’s restless soul
until he was three centuries too late?</p>

<p>For myself, I confess that the last twenty-five
years of the eighteenth century and the
first twenty-five years of the nineteenth make
up my chosen period, and that my motive for
so choosing is contemptible. It was not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
time distinguished—in England at least—for
wit or wisdom, for public virtues or for
private charm; but it <i>was</i> a time when literary
reputations were so cheaply gained that nobody
needed to despair of one. A taste for platitudes,
a tinge of Pharisaism, an appreciation of the
commonplace,—and the thing was done. It
was in the latter half of this blissful period
that we find that enthusiastic chronicler, Mrs.
Cowley, writing in “Public Characters” of
“the proud preëminence which, in all the varieties
of excellence produced by the pen, the
pencil, or the lyre, the ladies of Great Britain
have attained over contemporaries in every
other country in Europe.”</p>

<p>When we search for proofs of this proud
preëminence, what do we find? Roughly speaking,
the period begins with Miss Burney, and
closes with Miss Terrier and Miss Jane Porter.
It includes—besides Miss Burney—one
star of the first magnitude, Miss Austen
(whose light never dazzled Mrs. Cowley’s eyes),
and one mild but steadfast planet, Miss Edgeworth.
The rest of Great Britain’s literary
ladies were enjoying a degree of fame and fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
so utterly disproportionate to their merits
that their toiling successors to-day may be pardoned
for wishing themselves part of that
happy sisterhood. Think of being able to find
a market for an interminable essay entitled
“Against Inconsistency in our Expectations”!
There lingers in all our hearts a desire to utter
moral platitudes, to dwell lingeringly and lovingly
upon the obvious; but alas! we are not
Mrs. Barbaulds, and this is not the year 1780.
Foolish and inconsequent we are permitted to
be, but tedious, never! And think of hearing
one’s own brother burst into song, that he
might fondly eulogize our</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Sacred gifts whose meed is deathless praise,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose potent charm the enraptured soul can raise.</div>
</div></div>

<p>There are few things more difficult to conceive
than an enthusiastic brother tunefully entreating
his sister to go on enrapturing the world
with her pen. Oh, thrice-favoured Anna Letitia
Barbauld, who could warm even the calm
fraternal heart into a glow of sensibility.</p>

<p>The publication of “Evelina” was the first
notable event in our happy half-century. Its
freshness and vivacity charmed all London;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
and Miss Burney, like Sheridan, had her applause
“dashed in her face, sounded in her
ears,” for the rest of a long and meritorious
life. Her second novel, “Cecilia,” was received
with such universal transport, that in a very
moral epilogue of a rather immoral play we
find it seriously commended to the public as
an antidote to vice:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Let sweet Cecilia gain your just applause,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose every passion yields to nature’s laws.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Miss Burney, blushing in the royal box, had
the satisfaction of hearing this stately advertisement
of her wares. Virtue was not left to
be its own reward in those fruitful and generous
years.</p>

<p>Indeed, the most comfortable characteristic
of the period, and the one which incites our
deepest envy, is the universal willingness to
accept a good purpose as a substitute for good
work. Even Madame d’Arblay, shrewd, caustic,
and quick-witted, forbears from unkind
criticism of the well-intentioned. She has nothing
but praise for Mrs. Barbauld’s poems, because
of “the piety and worth they exhibit”;
and she rises to absolute enthusiasm over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
anti-slavery epistle, declaring that its energy
“springs from the real spirit of virtue.” Yet
to us the picture of the depraved and luxurious
West Indian ladies—about whom it is
safe to say good Mrs. Barbauld knew very
little—seems one of the most unconsciously
humorous things in English verse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
Lo! where reclined, pale Beauty courts the breeze,</div>
<div class="verse">Diffused on sofas of voluptuous ease.</div>

<hr class="tiny" />

<div class="verse">With languid tones imperious mandates urge,</div>
<div class="verse">With arm recumbent wield the household scourge.</div>
</div></div>

<p>There are moments when Mrs. Barbauld soars
to the inimitable, when she reaches the highest
and happiest effect that absurdity is able to
produce.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">With arm recumbent wield the household scourge</div>
</div></div>

<p>is one of these inspirations; and another is this
pregnant sentence, which occurs in a chapter
of advice to young girls: “An ass is much
better adapted than a horse to show off a
lady.”</p>

<p>To point to Hannah More as a brilliant and
bewildering example of sustained success is to
give the most convincing proof that it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
good thing to be born in the year 1745. Miss
More’s reputation was already established at
the dawning of my cherished half-century, and,
for the whole fifty years, her life was a series
of social, literary, and religious triumphs. In
her youth, she was mistaken for a wit. In her
old age, she was revered as a saint. In her
youth, Garrick called her “Nine,”—gracefully
intimating that she embodied the attributes of
all the Muses. In her old age, an acquaintance
wrote to her: “You who are secure of the
approbation of angels may well hold human
applause to be of small consequence.” In her
youth, she wrote a play that everybody went
to see. In her old age, she wrote tracts that
everybody bought and distributed. Prelates
composed Latin verses in her honour; and
when her “Estimate of the Religion of the
Fashionable World” was published anonymously,
the Bishop of London exclaimed in
a kind of pious transport, “Aut Morus, aut
Angelus!” Her tragedy, “Percy,” melted the
heart of London. Men “shed tears in abundance,”
and women were “choked with emotion”
over the “affecting circumstances of the Piece.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Sir William Pepys confessed that “Percy”
“broke his heart”; and that he thought it “a
kind of profanation” to wipe his eyes, and go
from the theatre to Lady Harcourt’s assembly.
Four thousand copies of the play were sold in
a fortnight; and the Duke of Northumberland
sent a special messenger to Miss More to
thank her for the honour she had done his
historic name.</p>

<p>As a novelist, Hannah was equally successful.
Twenty thousand copies of “Cœlebs in
Search of a Wife” were sold in England, and
thirty thousand in America. “The Americans
are a very approving people,” acknowledged
the gratified authoress. In Iceland “Cœlebs”
was read—so Miss More says—“with great
apparent profit”; while certain very popular
tracts, like “Charles the Footman” and “The
Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,” made their edifying
way to Moscow, and were found by the
missionary Gericke in the library of the Rajah
of Tanjore. “All this and Heaven, too!” as a
reward for being born in 1745. The injustice
of the thing stings us to the soul. Yet it was
the unhesitating assumption of Heaven’s co-partnership<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
which gave to Hannah More the
best part of her earthly prestige, and made her
verdicts a little like Protestant Bulls. When
she objected to “Marmion” and “The Lady
of the Lake” for their lack of “practical precept,”
these sinless poems were withdrawn from
Evangelical book-shelves. Her biographer, Mr.
Thompson, thought it necessary to apologize
for her correspondence with that agreeable
worldling, Horace Walpole, and to assure us
that “the fascinations of Walpole’s false wit
must have retired before the bright ascendant
of her pure and prevailing superiority.” As
she waxed old, and affluent, and disputatious,
it was deemed well to encourage a timid public
with the reminder that her genius, though
“great and commanding,” was still “lovely and
kind.” And when she died, it was recorded
that “a cultivated taste for moral scenery was
one of her distinctions”;—as though Nature
herself attended a class of ethics before venturing
to allure too freely the mistress of Barley
Wood.</p>

<p>It is in the contemplation of such sunlight
mediocrity that the hardship of being born too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
late is felt with crushing force. Why cannot
we write “Letters on the Improvement of the
Mind,” and be held, like Mrs. Chapone, to be
an authority on education all the rest of our
lives; and have people entreating us, as they
entreated her, to undertake, at any cost, the
intellectual guidance of their daughters? When
we consider all that a modern educator is
expected to know—from bird-calls to metric
measures—we sigh over the days which demanded
nothing more difficult than the polite
expression of truisms.</p>

<p>“Our feelings are not given us for our ornament,
but to spur us on to right action. Compassion,
for instance, is not impressed upon the
human heart, only to adorn the fair face with
tears, and to give an agreeable languor to the
eyes. It is designed to excite our utmost endeavour
to relieve the sufferer.”</p>

<p>Was it really worth while to say this even
in 1775? Is it possible that young ladies were
then in danger of thinking that the office of
compassion was to “adorn a face with tears”?
and did they try to be sorry for the poor and
sick, only that their bright eyes might be softened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
into languor? Yet we know that Mrs.
Chapone’s little volume was held to have rendered
signal service to society. It has the honour
to be one of the books which Miss Lydia
Languish lays out ostentatiously on her table—in
company with Fordyce’s sermons—when
she anticipates a visit from Mrs. Malaprop
and Sir Anthony. Some halting verses of the
period exalt it as the beacon light of youth;
and Mrs. Delany, writing to her six-year-old
niece, counsels the little girl to read the
“Letters” once a year until she is grown up.
“They speak to the heart as well as to the
head,” she assures the poor infant; “and I
know no book (next to the Bible) more entertaining
and edifying.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu gave dinners. The real and
very solid foundation of <i>her</i> reputation was the
admirable manner in which she fed her lions.
A mysterious halo of intellectuality surrounded
this excellent hostess. “The female Mæcenas
of Hill Street,” Hannah More elegantly termed
her, adding,—to prove that she herself was
not unduly influenced by gross food and drink,—“But
what are baubles, when speaking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
a Montagu!” Dr. Johnson praised her conversation,—especially
when he wanted to tease
jealous Mrs. Thrale,—but sternly discountenanced
her attempts at authorship. When Sir
Joshua Reynolds observed that the “Essay on
the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare” did
its authoress honour, Dr. Johnson retorted
contemptuously: “It does <i>her</i> honour, but it
would do honour to nobody else,”—which
strikes me as a singularly unpleasant thing to
hear said about one’s literary masterpiece.
Like the fabled Caliph who stood by the Sultan’s
throne, translating the flowers of Persian
speech into comprehensible and unflattering
truths, so Dr. Johnson stands undeceived
in this pleasant half-century of pretence, translating
its ornate nonsense into language we
can too readily understand.</p>

<p>But how comfortable and how comforting
the pretence must have been, and how kindly
tolerant all the pretenders were to one another!
If, in those happy days, you wrote an essay on
“The Harmony of Numbers and Versification,”
you unhesitatingly asked your friends to
come and have it read aloud to them; and your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
friends—instead of leaving town next day—came,
and listened, and called it a “Miltonic
evening.” If, like Mrs. Montagu, you had a
taste for letter-writing, you filled up innumerable
sheets with such breathless egotisms as
this:—</p>

<p>“I come, a happy guest, to the general feast
Nature spreads for all her children, my spirits
dance in the sunbeams, or take a sweet repose
in the shade. I rejoice in the grand chorus of
the day, and feel content in the silent serene
of night, while I listen to the morning hymn
of the whole animal creation, I recollect how
beautiful it is, sum’d up in the works of our
great poet, Milton, every rivulet murmurs in
poetical cadence, and to the melody of the
nightingale I add the harmonious verses she
has inspired in many languages.”</p>

<p>So highly were these rhapsodies appreciated,
and so far were correspondents from demanding
either coherence or punctuation, that four
volumes of Mrs. Montagu’s letters were published
after her death; and we find Miss More
praising Mrs. Boscawen because she approached
this standard of excellence: “Mrs. Palk tells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
me her letters are hardly inferior to Mrs. Montagu’s.”</p>

<p>Those were the days to live in, and sensible
people made haste to be born in time. The
close of the eighteenth century saw quiet
country families tearing the freshly published
“Mysteries of Udolpho” into a dozen parts,
because no one could wait his turn to read the
book. All England held its breath while Emily
explored the haunted chambers of her prison-house.
The beginning of the nineteenth century
found Mrs. Opie enthroned as a peerless
novel-writer, and the “Edinburgh Review”
praising “Adeline Mowbray, or Mother and
Daughter,” as the most pathetic story in the
English language. Indeed, one sensitive gentleman
wrote to its authoress that he had lain
awake all night, bathed in tears, after reading
it. About this time, too, we begin to hear “the
mellow tones of Felicia Hemans,” whom Christopher
North reverently admired; and who, we
are assured, found her way to all hearts that
were open to “the holy sympathies of religion
and virtue.” Murray’s heart was so open that
he paid two hundred guineas for the “Vespers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of Palermo”; and Miss Edgeworth considered
that the “Siege of Valencia” contained the
most beautiful poetry she had read for years.
Finally Miss Jane Porter looms darkly on the
horizon, with novels five volumes long. All
the Porters worked on a heroic scale. Anna
Maria’s stories were more interminable than
Jane’s; and their brother Robert painted on a
single canvas, “The Storming of Seringapatam,”
seven hundred life-sized figures.</p>

<p>“Thaddeus of Warsaw” and “The Scottish
Chiefs” were books familiar to our infancy.
They stretched vastly and vaguely over many
tender years,—stories after the order of Melchisedec,
without beginning and without end.
But when our grandmothers were young, and
my chosen period had still years to run, they
were read on two continents, and in many
tongues. The King of Würtemberg was so
pleased with “Thaddeus” that he made Miss
Porter a “lady of the Chapter of St. Joachim,”—which
sounds both imposing and mysterious.
The badge of the order was a gold cross; and
this unusual decoration, coupled with the lady’s
habit of draping herself in flowing veils like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
one of Mrs. Radcliffe’s heroines, so confused
an honest British public that it was deemed
necessary to explain to agitated Protestants
that Miss Porter had no Popish proclivities,
and must not be mistaken for a nun. In our
own country her novels were exceedingly popular,
and her American admirers sent her a rose-wood
armchair in token of appreciation and
esteem. It is possible she would have preferred
a royalty on her books; but the armchair was
graciously accepted, and a pen-and-ink sketch
in an album of celebrities represents Miss Porter
seated majestically on its cushions, “in the
quiet and ladylike occupation of taking a cup
of coffee.”</p>

<p>And so my happy half-century draws to its
appointed end. A new era, cold, critical, contentious,
deprecated the old genial absurdities,
chilled the old sentimental outpourings, questioned
the old profitable pietism. Unfortunates,
born a hundred years too late, look back with
wistful eyes upon the golden age which they
feel themselves qualified to adorn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PERILS OF IMMORTALITY</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">Peu de génie, point de grâce.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no harder fate than to be immortalized
as a fool; to have one’s name—which merits
nothing sterner than obliteration—handed
down to generations as an example of silliness,
or stupidity, or presumption; to be enshrined
pitilessly in the amber of the “Dunciad”; to be
laughed at forever because of Charles Lamb’s
impatient and inextinguishable raillery. When
an industrious young authoress named Elizabeth
Ogilvy Benger—a model of painstaking insignificance—invited
Charles and Mary Lamb to
drink tea with her one cold December night, she
little dreamed she was achieving a deathless and
unenviable fame; and that, when her half dozen
books should have lapsed into comfortable oblivion,
she herself should never be fortunate enough
to be forgotten. It is a cruel chance which crystallizes
the folly of an hour, and makes it outlive
our most serious endeavours. Perhaps we
should do well to consider this painful possibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
before hazarding an acquaintance with
the Immortals.</p>

<p>Miss Benger did more than hazard. She
pursued the Immortals with insensate zeal. She
bribed Mrs. Inchbald’s servant-maid into lending
her cap, and apron, and tea-tray; and, so
equipped, penetrated into the inmost sanctuary
of that literary lady, who seems to have taken
the intrusion in good part. She was equally
adroit in seducing Mary Lamb—as the Serpent
seduced Eve—when Charles Lamb was the
ultimate object of her designs. Coming home
to dinner one day, “hungry as a hunter,” he
found to his dismay the two women closeted
together, and trusted he was in time to prevent
their exchanging vows of eternal friendship,
though not—as he discovered later—in time
to save himself from an engagement to drink
tea with the stranger (“I had never seen her
before, and could not tell who the devil it was
that was so familiar”), the following night.</p>

<p>What happened is told in a letter to Coleridge;
one of the best-known and one of the longest
letters Lamb ever wrote,—he is so brimful
of his grievance. Miss Benger’s lodgings were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
up two flights of stairs in East Street. She entertained
her guests with tea, coffee, macaroons,
and “much love.” She talked to them, or rather
<i>at</i> them, upon purely literary topics,—as, for
example, Miss Hannah More’s “Strictures on
Female Education,” which they had never read.
She addressed Mary Lamb in French,—“possibly
having heard that neither Mary nor I
understood French,”—and she favoured them
with Miss Seward’s opinion of Pope. She
asked Lamb, who was growing more miserable
every minute, if he agreed with D’Israeli as to the
influence of organism upon intellect; and when
he tried to parry the question with a pun upon
organ—“which went off very flat”—she despised
him for his feeble flippancy. She advised
Mary to carry home two translations of “Pizarro,”
so that she might compare them <i>verbatim</i>
(an offer hastily declined), and she made
them both promise to return the following week—which
they never did—to meet Miss Jane
Porter and her sister, “who, it seems, have
heard much of Mr. Coleridge, and wish to meet
<i>us</i> because we are <i>his</i> friends.” It is a <i>comédie
larmoyante</i>. We sympathize hotly with Lamb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
when we read his letter; but there is something
piteous in the thought of the poor little hostess
going complacently to bed that night, and never
realizing that she had made her one unhappy
flight to fame.</p>

<p>There were people, strange as it may seem,
who liked Miss Benger’s evenings. Miss Aikin
assures us that “her circle of acquaintances
extended with her reputation, and with the
knowledge of her excellent qualities, and she
was often enabled to assemble as guests at her
humble tea-table names whose celebrity would
have insured attention in the proudest salons
of the metropolis.” Crabb Robinson, who was
a frequent visitor, used to encounter large
parties of sentimental ladies; among them, Miss
Porter, Miss Landon, and the “eccentric but
amiable” Miss Wesley,—John Wesley’s niece,—who
prided herself upon being broad-minded
enough to have friends of varying religions,
and who, having written two unread novels, remarked
complacently to Miss Edgeworth: “We
sisters of the quill ought to know one another.”</p>

<p>The formidable Lady de Crespigny of Campion
Lodge was also Miss Benger’s condescending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
friend and patroness, and this august matron—of
insipid mind and imperious temper—was
held to sanctify in some mysterious manner
all whom she honoured with her notice.
The praises lavished upon Lady de Crespigny
by her contemporaries would have made Hypatia
blush, and Sappho hang her head. Like
Mrs. Jarley, she was the delight of the nobility
and gentry. She corresponded, so we are told,
with the <i>literati</i> of England; she published,
like a British Cornelia, her letters of counsel
to her son; she was “courted by the gay and
admired by the clever”; and she mingled at
Campion Lodge “the festivity of fashionable
parties with the pleasures of intellectual society,
and the comforts of domestic peace.”</p>

<p>To this array of feminine virtue and feminine
authorship, Lamb was singularly unresponsive.
He was not one of the <i>literati</i> honoured
by Lady de Crespigny’s correspondence.
He eluded the society of Miss Porter, though
she was held to be handsome,—for a novelist.
(“The only literary lady I ever knew,” writes
Miss Mitford, “who didn’t look like a scarecrow
to keep birds from cherries.”) He said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
unkindly of Miss Landon that, if she belonged
to him, he would lock her up and feed her on
bread and water until she left off writing poetry.
And for Miss Wesley he entertained a
cordial animosity, only one degree less lively
than his sentiments towards Miss Benger.
Miss Wesley had a lamentable habit of sending
her effusions to be read by reluctant men
of letters. She asked Lamb for Coleridge’s address,
which he, to divert the evil from his own
head, cheerfully gave. Coleridge, very angry,
reproached his friend for this disloyal baseness;
but Lamb, with the desperate instinct of
self-preservation, refused all promise of amendment.
“You encouraged that mopsey, Miss
Wesley, to dance after you,” he wrote tartly,
“in the hope of having her nonsense put into
a nonsensical Anthology. We have pretty well
shaken her off by that simple expedient of
referring her to you; but there are more burs
in the wind.”... “Of all God’s creatures,”
he cries again, in an excess of ill-humour, “I
detest letters-affecting, authors-hunting ladies.”
Alas for Miss Benger when she hunted hard,
and the quarry turned at bay!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>An atmosphere of inexpressible dreariness
hangs over the little coterie of respectable, unilluminated
writers, who, to use Lamb’s priceless
phrase, encouraged one another in mediocrity.
A vapid propriety, a mawkish sensibility
were their substitutes for real distinction of
character or mind. They read Mary Wollstonecraft’s
books, but would not know the author;
and when, years later, Mrs. Gaskell presented
the widowed Mrs. Shelley to Miss Lucy Aikin,
that outraged spinster turned her back upon
the erring one, to the profound embarrassment
of her hostess. Of Mrs. Inchbald, we read in
“Public Characters” for 1811: “Her moral
qualities constitute her principal excellence;
and though useful talents and personal accomplishments,
of themselves, form materials for
an agreeable picture, moral character gives the
polish which fascinates the heart.” The conception
of goodness then in vogue is pleasingly
illustrated by a passage from one of Miss
Elizabeth Hamilton’s books, which Miss Benger
in her biography of that lady (now lost to
fame) quotes appreciatively:—</p>

<p>“It was past twelve o’clock. Already had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the active and judicious Harriet performed
every domestic task; and, having completely
regulated the family economy for the day, was
quietly seated at work with her aunt and sister,
listening to Hume’s ‘History of England,’ as
it was read to her by some orphan girl whom
she had herself instructed.”</p>

<p>So truly ladylike had the feminine mind
grown by this time, that the very language it
used was refined to the point of ambiguity.
Mrs. Barbauld writes genteelly of the behaviour
of young girls “to the other half of their
species,” as though she could not bear to say,
simply and coarsely, men. So full of content
were the little circles who listened to the “elegant
lyric poetess,” Mrs. Hemans, or to “the
female Shakespeare of her age,” Miss Joanna
Baillie (we owe both these phrases to the poet
Campbell), that when Crabb Robinson was
asked by Miss Wakefield whether he would
like to know Mrs. Barbauld, he cried enthusiastically:
“You might as well ask me whether
I should like to know the Angel Gabriel!”</p>

<p>In the midst of these sentimentalities and raptures,
we catch now and then forlorn glimpses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
of the Immortals,—of Wordsworth at a literary
entertainment in the house of Mr. Hoare
of Hampstead, sitting mute and miserable all
evening in a corner,—which, as Miss Aikin
truly remarked, was “disappointing and provoking;”
of Lamb carried by the indefatigable
Crabb Robinson to call on Mrs. Barbauld.
This visit appears to have been a distinct failure.
Lamb’s one recorded observation was that
Gilbert Wakefield had a peevish face,—an
awkward remark, as Wakefield’s daughter sat
close at hand and listening. “Lamb,” writes
Mr. Robinson, “was vexed, but got out of the
scrape tolerably well,”—having had, indeed,
plenty of former experiences to help him on
the way.</p>

<p>There is a delightful passage in Miss Jane
Porter’s diary which describes at length an
evening spent at the house of Mrs. Fenwick,
“the amiable authoress of ‘Secrecy.’” (Everybody
was the amiable authoress of something.
It was a day, like our own, given over to the
worship of ink.) The company consisted of
Miss Porter and her sister Maria, Miss Benger
and her brother, the poet Campbell, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
nephew, a young man barely twenty years of
age. The lion of the little party was of course
the poet, who endeared himself to Mrs. Fenwick’s
heart by his attentions to her son, “a
beautiful boy of six.”</p>

<p>“This child’s innocence and caresses,” writes
Miss Porter gushingly, “seemed to unbend the
lovely feelings of Campbell’s heart. Every restraint
but those which the guardian angels of
tender infancy acknowledge was thrown aside.
I never saw Man in a more interesting point
of view. I felt how much I esteemed the author
of the ‘Pleasures of Hope.’ When we returned
home, we walked. It was a charming summer
night. The moon shone brightly. Maria leaned
on Campbell’s arm. I did the same by Benger’s.
Campbell made some observations on <i>pedantic</i>
women. I did not like it, being anxious for
the respect of this man. I was jealous about
how nearly he might think <i>we</i> resembled that
character. When the Bengers parted from us,
Campbell observed my abstraction, and with
sincerity I confessed the cause. I know not
what were his replies; but they were so gratifying,
so endearing, so marked with truth, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
when we arrived at the door, and he shook us
by the hand, as a sign of adieu immediately
prior to his next day’s journey to Scotland,
we parted with evident marks of being all in
tears.”</p>

<p>It is rather disappointing, after this outburst
of emotion, to find Campbell, in a letter to
his sister, describing Miss Porter in language
of chilling moderation: “Among the company
was Miss Jane Porter, whose talents my <i>nephew</i>
adores. She is a pleasing woman, and made
quite a conquest of him.”</p>

<p>Miss Benger was only one of the many
aspirants to literary honours whose futile endeavours
vexed and affronted Charles Lamb.
In reality she burdened him far less than
others who, like Miss Betham and Miss Stoddart,
succeeded in sending him their verses for
criticism, or who begged him to forward the
effusions to Southey,—an office he gladly fulfilled.
Perhaps Miss Benger’s vivacity jarred
upon his taste. He was fastidious about the
gayety of women. Madame de Staël considered
her one of the most interesting persons she
had met in England; but the approval of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
“impudent clever” Frenchwoman would have
been the least possible recommendation to
Lamb. If he had known how hard had been
Miss Benger’s struggles, and how scanty her
rewards, he might have forgiven her that sad
perversity which kept her toiling in the field
of letters. She had had the misfortune to be a
precocious child, and had written at the age
of thirteen a poem called “The Female Geniad,”
which was dedicated to Lady de Crespigny,
and published under the patronage of
that honoured dame. Youthful prodigies were
then much in favour. Miss Mitford comments
very sensibly upon them, being filled with pity
for one Mary Anne Browne, “a fine tall girl
of fourteen, and a full-fledged authoress,” who
was extravagantly courted and caressed one
season, and cruelly ignored the next. The
“Female Geniad” sealed Miss Benger’s fate.
When one has written a poem at thirteen,
and that poem has been printed and praised,
there is nothing for it but to keep on writing
until Death mercifully removes the obligation.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the drama—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
then, as now, was the goal of every author’s
ambition—first fired Miss Benger’s zeal.
When we think of Miss Hannah More as a
successful playwright, it is hard to understand
how any one could fail; yet fail Miss Benger
did, although we are assured by her biographer
that “her genius appeared in many ways well
adapted to the stage.” She next wrote a mercilessly
long poem upon the abolition of the slave-trade
(which was read only by anti-slavery agitators),
and two novels,—“Marian,” and
“Valsinore: or, the Heart and the Fancy.”
Of these we are told that “their excellences
were such as genius only can reach”; and if
they also missed their mark, it must have been
because—as Miss Aikin delicately insinuates—“no
judicious reader could fail to perceive
that the artist was superior to the work.” This
is always unfortunate. It is the work, and not
the artist, which is offered for sale in the market-place.
Miss Benger’s work is not much worse
than a great deal which did sell, and she possessed
at least the grace of an unflinching and
courageous perseverance. Deliberately, and
without aptitude or training, she began to write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
history, and in this most difficult of all fields
won for herself a hearing. Her “Life of Anne
Boleyn,” and her “Memoirs of Mary, Queen
of Scots,” were read in many an English schoolroom;
their propriety and Protestantism making
them acceptable to the anxious parental mind.
A single sentence from “Anne Boleyn” will
suffice to show the ease of Miss Benger’s mental
attitude, and the comfortable nature of her
views:—</p>

<p>“It would be ungrateful to forget that the
mother of Queen Elizabeth was the early and
zealous advocate of the Reformation, and that,
by her efforts to dispel the gloom of ignorance
and superstition, she conferred on the English
people a benefit of which, in the present advanced
state of knowledge and civilization, it
would be difficult to conceive or to appreciate
the real value and importance.”</p>

<p>The “active and judicious Harriet” would
have listened to this with as much complacence
as to Hume.</p>

<p>In “La Belle Assemblée” for April, 1823,
there is an engraving of Miss Smirke’s portrait
of Miss Benger. She is painted in an imposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
turban, with tight little curls, and an
air of formidable sprightliness. It was this
sprightliness which was so much admired.
“Wound up by a cup of coffee,” she would
talk for hours, and her friends really seem to
have liked it. “Her lively imagination,” writes
Miss Aikin, “and the flow of eloquence it inspired,
aided by one of the most melodious of
voices, lent an inexpressible charm to her conversation,
which was heightened by an intuitive
discernment of character, rare in itself, and
still more so in combination with such fertility
of fancy and ardency of feeling.”</p>

<p>This leaves little to be desired. It is not at
all like the Miss Benger of Lamb’s letter, with
her vapid pretensions and her stupid insolence.
Unhappily, we see through Lamb’s eyes, and
we cannot see through Miss Aikin’s. Of one
thing only I feel sure. Had Miss Benger,
instead of airing her trivial acquirements, told
Lamb that when she was a little girl, bookless
and penniless, at Chatham, she used to read
the open volumes in the booksellers’ windows,
and go back again and again, hoping that the
leaves might be turned, she would have touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
a responsive chord in his heart. Who does not
remember his exquisite sympathy for “street-readers,”
and his unlikely story of Martin
B——, who “got through two volumes of
‘Clarissa,’” in this desultory fashion. Had he
but known of the shabby, eager child, staring
wistfully at the coveted books, he would never
have written the most amusing of his letters,
and Miss Benger’s name would be to-day unknown.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WHEN LALLA ROOKH WAS YOUNG</h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And give you, mixed with western sentimentalism,</div>
<div class="verse">Some glimpses of the finest orientalism.</div>
</div></div>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Stick</span> to the East,” wrote Byron to Moore, in
1813. “The oracle, Staël, told me it was the
only poetic policy. The North, South, and West
have all been exhausted; but from the East we
have nothing but Southey’s unsaleables, and
these he has contrived to spoil by adopting only
their most outrageous fictions. His personages
don’t interest us, and yours will. You will have
no competitors; and, if you had, you ought to
be glad of it. The little I have done in that
way is merely a ‘voice in the wilderness’ for
you; and if it has had any success, that also will
prove that the public are orientalizing, and pave
the way for you.”</p>

<p>There is something admirably business-like
in this advice. Byron, who four months before
had sold the “Giaour” and the “Bride of Abydos”
to Murray for a thousand guineas, was
beginning to realize the commercial value of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
poetry; and, like a true man of affairs, knew
what it meant to corner a poetic market. He
was generous enough to give Moore the tip,
and to hold out a helping hand as well; for he
sent him six volumes of Castellan’s “Mœurs
des Ottomans,” and three volumes of Toderini’s
“De la Littérature des Turcs.” The orientalism
afforded by text-books was the kind that
England loved.</p>

<p>From the publication of “Lalla Rookh” in
1817 to the publication of Thackeray’s “Our
Street” in 1847, Byron’s far-sighted policy continued
to bear golden fruit. For thirty years
Caliphs and Deevs, Brahmins and Circassians,
rioted through English verse; mosques and
seraglios were the stage properties of English
fiction; the bowers of Rochnabed, the Lake of
Cashmere, became as familiar as Richmond and
the Thames to English readers. Some feeble
washings of this great tidal wave crossed the
estranging sea, to tint the pages of the New
York “Mirror,” and kindred journals in the
United States. Harems and slave-markets, with
beautiful Georgians and sad, slender Arab girls,
thrilled our grandmothers’ kind hearts. Tales<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of Moorish Lochinvars, who snatch away the
fair daughters—or perhaps the fair wives—of
powerful rajahs, captivated their imaginations.
Gazelles trot like poodles through these
stories, and lend colour to their robust Saxon
atmosphere. In one, a neglected “favourite”
wins back her lord’s affection by the help of a
slave-girl’s amulet; and the inconstant Moslem,
entering the harem, exclaims, “Beshrew me
that I ever thought another fair!”—which
sounds like a penitent Tudor.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A Persian’s Heaven is easily made,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis but black eyes and lemonade;</div>
</div></div>

<p>and our oriental literature was compounded of
the same simple ingredients. When the New
York “Mirror,” under the guidance of the versatile
Mr. Willis, tried to be impassioned and
sensuous, it dropped into such wanton lines as
these to a “Sultana”:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">She came,—soft leaning on her favourite’s arm,</div>
<div class="verse">She came, warm panting from the sultry hours,</div>
<div class="verse">To rove mid fragrant shades of orange bowers,</div>
<div class="verse">A veil light shadowing each voluptuous charm.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And for this must Lord Byron stand responsible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>The happy experiment of grafting Turkish
roses upon English boxwood led up to some curious
complications, not the least of which was
the necessity of stiffening the moral fibre of the
Orient—which was esteemed to be but lax—until
it could bear itself in seemly fashion before
English eyes. The England of 1817 was
not, like the England of 1908, prepared to give
critical attention to the decadent. It presented
a solid front of denial to habits and ideas which
had not received the sanction of British custom;
which had not, through national adoption,
become part of the established order of the universe.
The line of demarcation between Providence
and the constitution was lightly drawn.
Jeffrey, a self-constituted arbiter of tastes and
morals, assured his nervous countrymen that,
although Moore’s verse was glowing, his principles
were sound.</p>

<p>“The characters and sentiments of ‘Lalla
Rookh’ belong to the poetry of rational, honourable,
considerate, and humane Europe; and
not to the childishness, cruelty, and profligacy
of Asia. So far as we have yet seen, there is
no sound sense, firmness of purpose, or principled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
goodness, except among the natives of
Europe and their genuine descendants.”</p>

<p>Starting with this magnificent assumption,
it became a delicate and a difficult task to unite
the customs of the East with the “principled
goodness” of the West; the “sound sense” of
the Briton with the fervour and fanaticism of
the Turk. Jeffrey held that Moore had effected
this alliance in the most tactful manner, and
had thereby “redeemed the character of oriental
poetry”; just as Mr. Thomas Haynes
Bayly, ten years later, “reclaimed festive song
from vulgarity.” More carping critics, however,
worried their readers a good deal on this
point; and the nonconformist conscience cherished
uneasy doubts as to Hafed’s irregular
courtship and Nourmahal’s marriage lines.
From across the sea came the accusing voice of
young Mr. Channing in the “North American,”
proclaiming that “harlotry has found in Moore
a bard to smooth her coarseness and veil her
effrontery, to give her languor for modesty,
and affectation for virtue.” The English
“Monthly Review,” less open to alarm, confessed
with a sigh “a depressing regret that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
with the exception of ‘Paradise and the Peri,’
no great moral effect is either attained or attempted
by ‘Lalla Rookh.’ To what purpose
all this sweetness and delicacy of thought and
language, all this labour and profusion of
Oriental learning? What head is set right
in one erroneous notion, what heart is softened
in one obdurate feeling, by this luxurious
quarto?”</p>

<p>It is a lamentable truth that Anacreon exhibits
none of Dante’s spiritual depth, and that
la reine Margot fell short of Queen Victoria’s
fireside qualities. Nothing could make a moralist
of Moore. The light-hearted creature was a
model of kindness, of courage, of conjugal fidelity;
but—reversing the common rule of life—he
preached none of the virtues that he practised.
His pathetic attempts to adjust his tales
to the established conventions of society failed
signally of their purpose. Even Byron wrote
him that little Allegra (as yet unfamiliar with
her alphabet) should not be permitted to read
“Lalla Rookh”; partly because it wasn’t proper,
and partly—which was prettily said—lest
she should discover “that there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
better poet than Papa.” It was reserved for
Moore’s followers to present their verses and
stories in the chastened form acceptable to
English drawing-rooms, and permitted to English
youth. “La Belle Assemblée” published in
1819 an Eastern tale called “Jahia and Meimoune,”
in which the lovers converse like the
virtuous characters in “Camilla.” Jahia becomes
the guest of an infamous sheik, who intoxicates
him with a sherbet composed of “sugar,
musk, and amber,” and presents him with five
thousand sequins and a beautiful Circassian
slave. When he is left alone with this damsel,
she addresses him thus: “I feel interested in
you, and present circumstances will save me
from the charge of immodesty, when I say
that I also love you. This love inspires me
with fresh horror at the crimes that are here
committed.”</p>

<p>Jahia protests that he respectfully returns
her passion, and that his intentions are of an
honourable character, whereupon the circumspect
maiden rejoins: “Since such are your
sentiments, I will perish with you if I fail in
delivering you”; and conducts him, through a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
tangle of adventures, to safety. Jahia then
places Meimoune under the chaperonage of
his mother until their wedding day; after
which we are happy to know that “they passed
their lives in the enjoyment of every comfort
attending on domestic felicity. If their lot was
not splendid or magnificent, they were rich in
mutual affection; and they experienced that
fortunate medium which, far removed from
indigence, aspires not to the accumulation of
immense wealth, and laughs at the unenvied
load of pomp and splendour, which it neither
seeks, nor desires to obtain.”</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that many obdurate hearts
were softened, and many erroneous notions
were set right by the influence of a story like
this. In the “Monthly Museum” an endless
narrative poem, “Abdallah,” stretched its slow
length along from number to number, blooming
with fresh moral sentiments on every page;
while from an arid wilderness of Moorish
love songs, and Persian love songs, and Circassian
love songs, and Hindu love songs, I
quote this “Arabian” love song, peerless amid
its peers:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thy hair is black as the starless sky,</div>
<div class="indent">And clasps thy neck as it loved its home;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet it moves at the sound of thy faintest sigh,</div>
<div class="indent">Like the snake that lies on the white sea-foam.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I love thee, Ibla. Thou art bright</div>
<div class="indent">As the white snow on the hills afar;</div>
<div class="verse">Thy face is sweet as the moon by night,</div>
<div class="indent">And thine eye like the clear and rolling star.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But the snow is poor and withers soon,</div>
<div class="indent">While thou art firm and rich in hope;</div>
<div class="verse">And never (like thine) from the face of the moon</div>
<div class="indent">Flamed the dark eye of the antelope.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The truth and accuracy of this last observation
should commend the poem to all lovers of
nature.</p>

<p>It is the custom in these days of morbid accuracy
to laugh at the second-hand knowledge
which Moore so proudly and so innocently displayed.
Even Mr. Saintsbury says some unkind
things about the notes to “Lalla Rookh,”—scraps
of twentieth-hand knowledge, <i>he</i> calls
them,—while pleasantly recording his affection
for the poem itself, an affection based upon the
reasonable ground of childish recollections. In
the well-ordered home of his infancy, none but
“Sunday books” might be read on Sundays
in nursery or schoolroom. “But this severity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
was tempered by one of those easements often
occurring in a world, which, if not the best, is
certainly not the worst of all possible worlds.
For the convenience of servants, or for some
other reason, the children were much more
in the drawing-room on Sundays than on any
other day; and it was an unwritten rule that
any book that lived in the drawing-room was
fit Sunday reading. The consequence was that
from the time I could read until childish things
were put away, I used to spend a considerable
part of the first day of the week in reading and
re-reading a collection of books, four of which
were Scott’s poems, ‘Lalla Rookh,’ ‘The Essays
of Elia,’ and Southey’s ‘Doctor.’ Therefore
it may be that I rank ‘Lalla Rookh’ too
high.”</p>

<p>Blessed memories, and thrice blessed influences
of childhood! But if “Lalla Rookh,”
like “Vathek,” was written to be the joy of
imaginative little boys and girls (alas for those
who now replace it with “Allan in Alaska,”
and “Little Cora on the Continent”), the notes
to “Lalla Rookh” were, to my infant mind,
even more enthralling than the poem. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
was a sketchiness about them, a detachment
from time and circumstance—I always hated
being told the whole of everything—which
led me day after day into fresh fields of conjecture.
The nymph who was encircled by a
rainbow, and bore a radiant son; the scimitars
that were so dazzling they made the warriors
wink; the sacred well which reflected the moon
at midday; and the great embassy that was
sent “from some port of the Indies”—a welcome
vagueness of geography—to recover a
monkey’s tooth, snatched away by some equally
nameless conqueror;—what child could fail to
love such floating stars of erudition?</p>

<p>Our great-grandfathers were profoundly
impressed by Moore’s text-book acquirements.
The “Monthly Review” quoted a solid page
of the notes to dazzle British readers, who confessed
themselves amazed to find a fellow countryman
so much “at home” in Persia and
Arabia. Blackwood authoritatively announced
that Moore was familiar, not only “with the
grandest regions of the human soul,”—which
is expected of a poet,—but also with the
remotest boundaries of the East; and that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
every tone and hue and form he was “purely
and intensely Asiatic.” “The carping criticism
of paltry tastes and limited understandings
faded before that burst of admiration with
which all enlightened spirits hailed the beauty
and magnificence of ‘Lalla Rookh.’”</p>

<p>Few people care to confess to “paltry tastes”
and “limited understandings.” They would
rather join in any general acclamation. “Browning’s
poetry obscure!” I once heard a lecturer
say with scorn. “Let us ask ourselves, ‘Obscure
to whom?’ No doubt a great many things are
obscure to long-tailed Brazilian apes.” After
which his audience, with one accord, admitted
that it understood “Sordello.” So when Jeffrey—great
umpire of games whose rules he never
knew—informed the British public that there
was not in “Lalla Rookh” “a simile, a description,
a name, a trait of history, or allusion of
romance that does not indicate entire familiarity
with the life, nature, and learning of the
East,” the public contentedly took his word
for it. When he remarked that “the dazzling
splendours, the breathing odours” of Araby
were without doubt Moore’s “native element,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the public, whose native element was neither
splendid nor sweet-smelling, envied the Irishman
his softer joys. “Lalla Rookh” might be
“voluptuous” (a word we find in every review
of the period), but its orientalism was beyond
dispute. Did not Mrs. Skinner tell Moore that
she had, when in India, translated the prose
interludes into Bengali, for the benefit of her
moonshee, and that the man was amazed at the
accuracy of the costumes? Did not the nephew
of the Persian ambassador in Paris tell Mr.
Stretch, who told Moore, that “Lalla Rookh”
had been translated into Persian; that the
songs—particularly “Bendemeer’s Stream”—were
sung “everywhere”; and that the
happy natives could hardly believe the whole
work had not been taken originally from a
Persian manuscript?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I’m told, dear Moore, your lays are sung</div>
<div class="indent">(Can it be true, you lucky man?)</div>
<div class="verse">By moonlight, in the Persian tongue,</div>
<div class="indent">Along the streets of Ispahan.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And not of Ispahan only; for in the winter
of 1821 the Berlin court presented “Lalla
Rookh” with such splendour, such wealth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
detail, and such titled actors, that Moore’s
heart was melted and his head was turned (as
any other heart would have been melted, and
any other head would have been turned) by
the reports thereof. A Grand Duchess of Russia
took the part of Lalla Rookh; the Duke of
Cumberland was Aurungzebe; and a beautiful
young sister of Prince Radzivil enchanted all
beholders as the Peri. “Nothing else was
talked about in Berlin” (it must have been a
limited conversation); the King of Prussia had
a set of engravings made of the noble actors in
their costumes; and the Crown Prince sent
word to Moore that he slept always with a copy
of “Lalla Rookh” under his pillow, which was
foolish, but flattering. Hardly had the echoes
of this royal fête died away, when Spontini
brought out in Berlin his opera “The Feast
of Roses,” and Moore’s triumph in Prussia
was complete. Byron, infinitely amused at the
success of his own good advice, wrote to the
happy poet: “Your Berlin drama is an honour
unknown since the days of Elkanah Settle,
whose ‘Empress of Morocco’ was presented
by the court ladies, which was, as Johnson remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
‘the last blast of inflammation to poor
Dryden.’”</p>

<p>Who shall say that this comparison is without
its dash of malice? There is a natural limit
to the success we wish our friends, even when
we have spurred them on their way.</p>

<p>If the English court did not lend itself with
much gayety or grace to dramatic entertainments,
English society was quick to respond to
the delights of a modified orientalism. That is
to say, it sang melting songs about bulbuls and
Shiraz wine; wore ravishing Turkish costumes
whenever it had a chance (like the beautiful
Mrs. Winkworth in the charades at Gaunt
House); and covered its locks—if they were
feminine locks—with turbans of portentous
size and splendour. When Mrs. Fitzherbert,
aged seventy-three, gave a fancy dress ball, so
many of her guests appeared as Turks, and
Georgians, and sultanas, that it was hard to
believe that Brighton, and not Stamboul, was
the scene of the festivity. At an earlier entertainment,
“a rural breakfast and promenade,”
given by Mrs. Hobart at her villa near Fulham,
and “graced by the presence of royalty,” the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
leading attraction was Mrs. Bristow, who represented
Queen Nourjahad in the “Garden
of Roses.” “Draped in all the magnificence of
Eastern grandeur, Mrs. Bristow was seated in
the larger drawing-room (which was very beautifully
fitted up with cushions in the Indian
style), smoking her hookah amidst all sorts of
the choicest perfumes. Mrs. Bristow was very
profuse with otto of roses, drops of which were
thrown about the ladies’ dresses. The whole
house was scented with the delicious fragrance.”</p>

<p>The “European Magazine,” the “Monthly
Museum,” all the dim old periodicals published
in the early part of the last century for feminine
readers, teem with such “society notes.”
From them, too, we learn that by 1823 turbans
of “rainbow striped gauze frosted with gold”
were in universal demand; while “black velvet
turbans, enormously large, and worn very much
on one side,” must have given a rakish appearance
to stout British matrons. “La Belle Assemblée”
describes for us with tender enthusiasm
a ravishing turban, “in the Turkish style,”
worn in the winter of 1823 at the theatre and
at evening parties. This masterpiece was of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
“pink oriental crêpe, beautifully folded in
front, and richly ornamented with pearls. The
folds are fastened on the left side, just above
the ear, with a Turkish scimitar of pearls; and
on the right side are tassels of pearls, surmounted
by a crescent and a star.”</p>

<p>Here we have Lady Jane or Lady Amelia
transformed at once into young Nourmahal;
and, to aid the illusion, a “Circassian corset”
was devised, free from encroaching steel or
whalebone, and warranted to give its English
wearers the “flowing and luxurious lines” admired
in the overfed inmates of the harem.
When the passion for orientalism began to subside
in London, remote rural districts caught
and prolonged the infection. I have sympathized
all my life with the innocent ambition
of Miss Matty Jenkyns to possess a sea-green
turban, like the one worn by Queen Adelaide;
and have never been able to forgive that ruthlessly
sensible Mary Smith—the chronicler of
Cranford—for taking her a “neat middle-aged
cap” instead. “I was most particularly anxious
to prevent her from disfiguring her small gentle
mousy face with a great Saracen’s head turban,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
says the judicious Miss Smith with
a smirk of self-commendation; and poor Miss
Matty—the cap being bought—has to bow
to this arbiter of fate. How much we all suffer
in life from the discretion of our families and
friends!</p>

<p>Thackeray laughed the dim ghost of “Lalla
Rookh” out of England. He mocked at the
turbans, and at the old ladies who wore them;
at the vapid love songs, and at the young ladies
who sang them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am a little brown bulbul. Come and listen in the moonlight.
Praise be to Allah! I am a merry bard.</p>
</div>

<p>He derided the “breathing odours of Araby,”
and the Eastern travellers who imported this
exotic atmosphere into Grosvenor Square.
Yonng Bedwin Sands, who has “lived under
tents,” who has published a quarto, ornamented
with his own portrait in various oriental costumes,
and who goes about accompanied by a
black servant of most unprepossessing appearance,
“just like another Brian de Bois Guilbert,”
is only a degree less ridiculous than
Clarence Bulbul, who gives Miss Tokely a piece
of the sack in which an indiscreet Zuleika was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
drowned, and whose servant says to callers:
“Mon maître est au divan,” or “Monsieur trouvera
Monsieur dans son sérail.... He has
coffee and pipes for everybody. I should like
you to have seen the face of old Bowly, his
college tutor, called upon to sit cross-legged
on a divan, a little cup of bitter black mocha
put into his hand, and a large amber-muzzled
pipe stuck into his mouth before he could say
it was a fine day. Bowly almost thought he had
compromised his principles by consenting so far
to this Turkish manner.” Bulbul’s sure and
simple method of commending himself to young
ladies is by telling them they remind him of a
girl he knew in Circassia,—Ameena, the sister
of Schamyle Bey. “Do you know, Miss Pim,”
he thoughtfully observes, “that you would fetch
twenty thousand piastres in the market at Constantinople?”
Whereupon Miss Pim is filled
with embarrassed elation. An English girl, conscious
of being in no great demand at home, was
naturally flattered as well as fluttered by the
thought of having market value elsewhere. And
perhaps this feminine instinct was at the root of
“Lalla Rookh’s” long popularity in England.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CORRESPONDENT</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">Correspondences are like small-clothes before the invention
of suspenders; it is impossible to keep them up.—<span class="smcap">Sydney
Smith</span> to <span class="smcap">Mrs. Crowe</span>.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this lamentable admission, in this blunt and
revolutionary sentiment, we hear the first clear
striking of a modern note, the first gasping protest
against the limitless demands of letter-writing.
When Sydney Smith was a little boy, it
was not impossible to keep a correspondence
up; it was impossible to let it go. He was ten
years old when Sir William Pepys copied out
long portions of Mrs. Montagu’s letters, and
left them as a legacy to his heirs. He was
twelve years old when Miss Anna Seward—the
“Swan of Lichfield”—copied thirteen
pages of description which the Rev. Thomas
Sedgwick Whalley had written her from Switzerland,
and sent them to her friend, Mr. William
Hayley. She called this “snatching him
to the Continent by Whalleyan magic.” What
Mr. Hayley called it we do not know; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
had his revenge, for the impartial “Swan”
copied eight verses of an “impromptu” which
Mr. Hayley had written upon her, and sent
them in turn to Mr. Whalley;—thus making
each friend a scourge to the other, and widening
the network of correspondence which had
enmeshed the world.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to feel a trifle envious of
Mr. Whalley, who looms before us as the most
petted and accomplished of clerical bores, of
“literary and chess-playing divines.” He was
but twenty-six when the kind-hearted Bishop
of Ely presented him with the living of Hagworthingham,
stipulating that he should not
take up his residence there,—the neighbourhood
of the Lincolnshire fens being considered
an unhealthy one. Mr. Whalley cheerfully complied
with this condition; and for fifty years
the duties were discharged by curates, who
could not afford good health; while the rector
spent his winters in Europe, and his summers
at Mendip Lodge. He was of an amorous disposition,—“sentimentally
pathetic,” Miss Burney
calls him,—and married three times, two
of his wives being women of fortune. He lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
in good society, and beyond his means, like a
gentleman; was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds
(who has very delicately and maliciously
accentuated his resemblance to the tiny spaniel
he holds in his arms); and died of old age, in
the comfortable assurance that he had lost
nothing the world could give. A voluminous
correspondence—afterwards published in two
volumes—afforded scope for that clerical diffuseness
which should have found its legitimate
outlet in the Hagworthingham pulpit.</p>

<p>The Rev. Augustus Jessup has recorded a
passionate admiration for Cicero’s letters, on
the ground that they never describe scenery;
but Mr. Whalley’s letters seldom do anything
else. He wrote to Miss Sophia Weston a description
of Vaucluse, which fills three closely
printed pages. Miss Weston copied every word,
and sent it to Miss Seward, who copied every
word of her copy, and sent it to the long-suffering
Mr. Hayley, with the remark that Mr.
Whalley and Petrarch were “kindred spirits.”
Later on this kinship was made pleasantly manifest
by the publication of “Edwy and Edilda,”
which is described as a “domestic epic,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
which Mr. Whalley’s friends considered to be
a moral bulwark as well as an epoch-making
poem. Indeed, we find Miss Seward imploring
him to republish it, on the extraordinary ground
that it will add to his happiness in heaven to
know that the fruits of his industry “continue
to inspire virtuous pleasure through passing
generations.” It is animating to contemplate
the celestial choirs congratulating the angel
Whalley at intervals on the “virtuous pleasure”
inspired by “Edwy and Edilda.” “This,” says
Mr. Kenwigs, “is an ewent at which Evin itself
looks down.”</p>

<p>There was no escape from the letter-writer
who, a hundred or a hundred and twenty-five
years ago, captured a coveted correspondent.
It would have been as easy to shake off an octopus
or a boa-constrictor. Miss Seward opened
her attack upon Sir Walter Scott, whom she
had never seen, with a long and passionate letter,
lamenting the death of a friend whom Scott
had never seen. She conjured him not to answer
this letter, because she was “dead to the
world.” Scott gladly obeyed, content that the
lady should be at least dead to him, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the last possibility she contemplated. Before
twelve months were out they were in brisk correspondence,
an acquaintance was established,
and when she died in earnest, some years later,
he found himself one of her literary executors,
and twelve quarto manuscript volumes of her
letters waiting to be published. These Scott
wisely refused to touch; but he edited her
poems,—a task he much disliked,—wrote the
epitaph on her monument in Lichfield Cathedral,
and kindly maintained that, although her
sentimentality appalled him, and her enthusiasm
chilled his soul, she was a talented and
pleasing person.</p>

<p>The most formidable thing about the letters
of this period—apart from their length—is
their eloquence. It bubbles and seethes over
every page. Miss Seward, writing to Mrs.
Knowles in 1789 upon the dawning of the
French Revolution, of which she understood no
more than a canary, pipes an ecstatic trill. “So
France has dipped her lilies in the living stream
of American freedom, and bids her sons be
slaves no longer. In such a contest the vital
sluices must be wastefully opened; but few English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
hearts I hope there are that do not wish
victory may sit upon the swords that freedom
has unsheathed.” It sounds so exactly like the
Americans in “Martin Chuzzlewit” that one
doubts whether Mr. Jefferson Brick or the
Honourable Elijah Pogram really uttered the
sentiment; while surely to Mrs. Hominy, and
not to the Lichfield Swan, must be credited
this beautiful passage about a middle-aged but
newly married couple: “The berries of holly,
with which Hymen formed that garland, blush
through the snows of time, and dispute the prize
of happiness with the roses of youth;—and
they are certainly less subject to the blights of
expectation and palling fancy.”</p>

<p>It is hard to conceive of a time when letters
like these were sacredly treasured by the recipients
(our best friend, the waste-paper basket,
seems to have been then unknown); when
the writers thereof bequeathed them as a legacy
to the world; and when the public—being
under no compulsion—bought six volumes of
them as a contribution to English literature.
It is hard to think of a girl of twenty-one writing
to an intimate friend as Elizabeth Robinson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
afterwards the “great” Mrs. Montagu, wrote
to the young Duchess of Portland, who appears
to have ventured upon a hope that they were
having a mild winter in Kent.</p>

<p>“I am obliged to your Grace for your good
wishes of fair weather; sunshine gilds every
object, but, alas! December is but cloudy weather,
how few seasons boast many days of calm!
April, which is the blooming youth of the year,
is as famous for hasty showers as for gentle sunshine.
May, June, and July have too much heat
and violence, the Autumn withers the Summer’s
gayety, and in the Winter the hopeful blossoms
of Spring and fair fruits of Summer are decayed,
and storms and clouds arise.”</p>

<p>After these obvious truths, for which the
almanac stands responsible, Miss Robinson proceeds
to compare human life to the changing
year, winding up at the close of a dozen pages:
“Happy and worthy are those few whose youth
is not impetuous, nor their age sullen; they
indeed should be esteemed, and their happy
influence courted.”</p>

<p>Twenty-one, and ripe for moral platitudes!
What wonder that we find the same lady, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
crowned with years and honours, writing to the
son of her friend, Lord Lyttelton, a remorselessly
long letter of precept and good counsel,
which that young gentleman (being afterwards
known as the wicked Lord Lyttelton) seems
never to have taken to heart.</p>

<p>“The morning of life, like the morning of
the day, should be dedicated to business. Give it
therefore, dear Mr. Lyttelton, to strenuous exertion
and labour of mind, before the indolence
of the meridian hour, or the unabated fervour
of the exhausted day, renders you unfit for
severe application.”</p>

<p>“Unabated fervour of the exhausted day”
is a phrase to be commended. We remember
with awe that Mrs. Montagu was the brightest
star in the chaste firmament of female intellect;—“the
first woman for literary knowledge
in England,” wrote Mrs. Thrale; “and, if in
England, I hope I may say in the world.” We
hope so, indeed. None but a libertine would
doubt it. And no one less contumelious than
Dr. Johnson ever questioned Mrs. Montagu’s
supremacy. She was, according to her great-grandniece,
Miss Climenson, “adored by men,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
while “purest of the pure”; which was equally
pleasant for herself and for Mr. Montagu.
She wrote more letters, with fewer punctuation
marks, than any Englishwoman of her
day; and her nephew, the fourth Baron Rokeby,
nearly blinded himself in deciphering the two
volumes of undated correspondence which were
printed in 1810. Two more followed in 1813,
after which the gallant Baron either died at his
post or was smitten with despair; for sixty-eight
cases of letters lay undisturbed for the
best part of a century, when they passed into
Miss Climenson’s hands. This intrepid lady
received them—so she says—with “unbounded
joy”; and has already published two
fat volumes, with the promise of several others
in the near future. “Les morts n’écrivent
point,” said Madame de Maintenon hopefully;
but of what benefit is this inactivity,
when we still continue to receive their letters?</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth Carter, called by courtesy
Mrs. Carter, was the most vigorous of Mrs.
Montagu’s correspondents. Although a lady
of learning, who read Greek and had dipped
into Hebrew, she was far too “humble and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
unambitious” to claim an acquaintance with
the exalted mistress of Montagu House; but
that patroness of literature treated her with
such true condescension that they were soon
on the happiest terms. When Mrs. Montagu
writes to Miss Carter that she has seen the
splendid coronation of George III, Miss Carter
hastens to remind her that such splendour is
for majesty alone.</p>

<p>“High rank and power require every external
aid of pomp and éclat that may awe and
astonish spectators by the ideas of the magnificent
and sublime; while the ornaments of
more equal conditions should be adapted to the
quiet tenour of general life, and be content to
charm and engage by the gentler graces of the
beautiful and pleasing.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu <i>was</i> fond of display. All her
friends admitted, and some deplored the fact.
But surely there was no likelihood of her appropriating
the coronation services as a feature
for the entertainments at Portman Square.</p>

<p>Advice, however, was the order of the day.
As the excellent Mrs. Chapone wrote to Sir
William Pepys: “It is a dangerous commerce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
for friends to praise each other’s Virtues, instead
of reminding each other of duties and
of failings.” Yet a too robust candour carried
perils of its own, for Miss Seward having
written to her “beloved Sophia Weston” with
“an ingenuousness which I thought necessary
for her welfare, but which her high spirits
would not brook,” Sophia was so unaffectedly
angry that twelve years of soothing silence
followed.</p>

<p>Another wonderful thing about the letter-writers,
especially the female letter-writers, of
this engaging period is the wealth of hyperbole
in which they rioted. Nothing is told in plain
terms. Tropes, metaphors, and similes adorn
every page; and the supreme elegance of the
language is rivalled only by the elusiveness of
the idea, which is lost in an eddy of words.
Marriage is always alluded to as the “hymeneal
torch,” or the “hymeneal chain,” or “hymeneal
emancipation from parental care.” Birds
are “feathered muses,” and a heart is a “vital
urn.” When Mrs. Montagu writes to Mr. Gilbert
West, that “miracle of the Moral World,”
to condole with him on his gout, she laments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
that his “writing hand, first dedicated to the
Muses, then with maturer judgment consecrated
to the Nymphs of Solyma, should be
led captive by the cruel foe.” If Mr. West
chanced not to know who or what the Nymphs
of Solyma were, he had the intelligent pleasure
of finding out. Miss Seward describes Mrs.
Tighe’s sprightly charms as “Aonian inspiration
added to the cestus of Venus”; and speaks
of the elderly “ladies of Llangollen” as, “in
all but the voluptuous sense, Armidas of its
bowers.” Duelling is to her “the murderous
punctilio of Luciferian honour.” A Scotch
gentleman who writes verse is “a Cambrian
Orpheus”; a Lichfield gentleman who sketches
is “our Lichfield Claude”; and a budding
clerical writer is “our young sacerdotal Marcellus.”
When the “Swan” wished to apprise
Scott of Dr. Darwin’s death, it never occurred
to her to write, as we in this dull age should
do: “Dr. Darwin died last night,” or, “Poor
Dr. Darwin died last night.” She wrote: “A
bright luminary in this neighbourhood recently
shot from his sphere with awful and deplorable
suddenness”;—thus pricking Sir Walter’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
imagination to the wonder point before
descending to facts. Even the rain and snow
were never spoken of in the plain language
of the Weather Bureau; and the elements had
a set of allegories all their own. Miss Carter
would have scorned to take a walk by the sea.
She “chased the ebbing Neptune.” Mrs. Chapone
was not blown by the wind. She was
“buffeted by Eolus and his sons.” Miss Seward
does not hope that Mr. Whalley’s rheumatism
is better; but that he has overcome “the malinfluence
of marine damps, and the monotonous
murmuring of boundless waters.” Perhaps
the most triumphant instance on record of sustained
metaphor is Madame d’Arblay’s account
of Mrs. Montagu’s yearly dinner to the London
chimney-sweeps, in which the word sweep is
never once used, so that the editor was actually
compelled to add a footnote to explain what
the lady meant. The boys are “jetty objects,”
“degraded outcasts from society,” and “sooty
little agents of our most blessed luxury.” They
are “hapless artificers who perform the most
abject offices of any authorized calling”; they
are “active guardians of our blazing hearth”;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
but plain chimney-sweeps, never! Madame
d’Arblay would have perished at the stake
before using so vulgar and obvious a term.</p>

<p>How was this mass of correspondence preserved?
How did it happen that the letters
were never torn up, or made into spills,—the
common fate of all such missives when I was a
little girl. Granted that Miss Carter treasured
Mrs. Montagu’s letters (she declared fervidly
she could never be so barbarous as to destroy
one), and that Mrs. Montagu treasured Miss
Carter’s. Granted that Miss Weston treasured
Mr. Whalley’s, and that Mr. Whalley treasured
Miss Weston’s. Granted that Miss Seward
provided against all contingencies by copying
her own letters into fat blank books before
they were mailed, elaborating her spineless
sentences, and omitting everything she deemed
too trivial or too domestic for the public ear.
But is it likely that young Lyttelton at Oxford
laid sacredly away Mrs. Montagu’s pages
of good counsel, or that young Franks at Cambridge
preserved the ponderous dissertations of
Sir William Pepys? Sir William was a Baronet,
a Master in Chancery, and—unlike his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
famous ancestor—a most respectable and exemplary
gentleman. His innocent ambition was
to be on terms of intimacy with the literary
lights of his day. He knew and ardently admired
Dr. Johnson, who in return detested him
cordially. He knew and revered, “in unison
with the rest of the world,” Miss Hannah More.
He corresponded at great length with lesser
lights,—with Mrs. Chapone, and Mrs. Hartley,
and Sir Nathaniel Wraxall. He wrote
endless commentaries on Homer and Virgil to
young Franks, and reams of good advice to his
little son at Eton. There is something pathetic
in his regret that the limitations of life will not
permit him to be as verbose as he would like.
“I could write for an hour,” he assures poor
Franks, “upon that most delightful of all passages,
the Lion deprived of its Young; but the
few minutes one can catch amidst the Noise,
hurry and confusion of an Assize town will not
admit of any Classical discussions. But was I
in the calm retirement of your Study at Acton,
I have much to say to you, to which I can only
allude.”</p>

<p>The publication of scores and scores of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
letters, all written to one unresponsive young
man at Cambridge (who is repeatedly reproached
for not answering them), makes us wonder
afresh who kept the correspondence; and the
problem is deepened by the appearance of Sir
William’s letters to his son. This is the way
the first one begins:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Boy</span>,—I cannot let a Post escape
me without giving you the Pleasure of
knowing how much you have gladdened the
Hearts of two as affectionate Parents as ever
lived; when you tell us that the Principles of
Religion begin already to exert their efficacy
in making you look down with contempt on the
wretched grovelling Vices with which you are
surrounded, you make the most delightful Return
you can ever make for our Parental Care
and Affection; you make Us at Peace with
Ourselves; and enable us to hope that our
dear Boy will Persevere in that Path which will
ensure the greatest Share of Comfort here, and
a certainty of everlasting Happiness hereafter.”</p>
</div>

<p>I am disposed to think that Sir William
made a fair copy of this letter and of others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
like it, and laid them aside as models of parental
exhortation. Whether young Pepys was
a little prig, or a particularly accomplished little
scamp (and both possibilities are open to consideration),
it seems equally unlikely that an Eton
boy’s desk would have proved a safe repository
for such ample and admirable discourses.</p>

<p>The publication of Cowper’s letters in 1803
and 1804 struck a chill into the hearts of accomplished
and erudite correspondents. Poor
Miss Seward never rallied from the shock of
their “commonness,” and of their popularity.
Here was a man who wrote about beggars and
postmen, about cats and kittens, about buttered
toast and the kitchen table. Here was a man
who actually looked at things before he described
them (which was a startling innovation);
who called the wind the wind, and buttercups
buttercups, and a hedgehog a hedgehog.
Miss Seward honestly despised Cowper’s letters.
She said they were without “imagination or
eloquence,” without “discriminative criticism,”
without “characteristic investigation.” Investigating
the relations between the family cat and
an intrusive viper was, from her point of view,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
unworthy the dignity of an author. Cowper’s
love of detail, his terrestrial turn of mind, his
humour, and his veracity were disconcerting
in an artificial age. When Miss Carter took a
country walk, she did not stoop to observe the
trivial things she saw. Apparently she never
saw anything. What she described were the
sentiments and emotions awakened in her by a
featureless principle called Nature. Even the
ocean—which is too big to be overlooked—started
her on a train of moral reflections, in
which she passed easily from the grandeur of the
elements to the brevity of life, and the paltriness
of earthly ambitions. “How vast are the
capacities of the soul, and how little and contemptible
its aims and pursuits.” With this
original remark, the editor of the letters (a
nephew and a clergyman) was so delighted that
he added a pious comment of his own.</p>

<p>“If such be the case, how strong and conclusive
is the argument deduced from it, that the
soul must be destined to another state more
suitable to its views and powers. It is much to
be lamented that Mrs. Carter did not pursue
this line of thought any further.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>People who bought nine volumes of a correspondence
like this were expected, as the editor
warns them, to derive from it “moral, literary,
and religious improvement.” It was in every
way worthy of a lady who had translated Epictetus,
and who had the “great” Mrs. Montagu
for a friend. But, as Miss Seward pathetically
remarked, “any well-educated person, with
talents not above the common level, produces
every day letters as well worth attention as
most of Cowper’s, especially as to diction.”
The perverseness of the public in buying, in
reading, in praising these letters, filled her with
pained bewilderment. Not even the writer’s
sincere and sad piety, his tendency to moralize,
and the transparent innocence of his life could
reconcile her to plain transcripts from nature,
or to such an unaffecting incident as this:—</p>

<p>“A neighbour of mine in Silver End keeps
an ass; the ass lives on the other side of the
garden wall, and I am writing in the greenhouse.
It happens that he is this morning most
musically disposed; either cheered by the fine
weather, or by some new tune which he has
just acquired, or by finding his voice more harmonious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
than usual. It would be cruel to mortify
so fine a singer, therefore I do not tell him
that he interrupts and hinders me; but I venture
to tell you so, and to plead his performance
in excuse of my abrupt conclusion.”</p>

<p>Here is not only the “common” diction
which Miss Seward condemned, but a very common
casualty, which she would have naturally
deemed beneath notice. Cowper wrote a great
deal about animals, and always with fine and
humorous appreciation. He sought relief from
the hidden torment of his soul in the contemplation
of creatures who fill their place in life
without morals, and without misgivings. We
know what safe companions they were for him
when we read his account of his hares, of his
kitten dancing on her hind legs,—“an exercise
which she performs with all the grace
imaginable,”—and of his goldfinches amorously
kissing each other between the cage wires.
When Miss Seward bent her mind to “the
lower orders of creation,” she did not describe
them at all; she gave them the benefit of that
“discriminative criticism” which she felt that
Cowper lacked. Here, for example, is her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
thoughtful analysis of man’s loyal servitor, the
dog:—</p>

<p>“That a dog is a noble, grateful, faithful
animal we must all be conscious, and deserves
a portion of man’s tenderness and care;—yet,
from its utter incapacity of more than glimpses
of rationality, there is a degree of insanity, as
well as of impoliteness to his acquaintance, and
of unkindness to his friends, in lavishing so
much more of his attention in the first instance,
and of affection in the latter, upon it than
upon them.”</p>

<p>It sounds like a parody on a great living
master of complex prose. By its side, Cowper’s
description of Beau is certainly open to the
reproach of plainness.</p>

<p>“My dog is a spaniel. Till Miss Gunning
begged him, he was the property of a farmer,
and had been accustomed to lie in the chimney
corner among the embers till the hair was
singed from his back, and nothing was left of
his tail but the gristle. Allowing for these
disadvantages, he is really handsome; and
when nature shall have furnished him with
a new coat, a gift which, in consideration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the ragged condition of his old one, it is hoped
she will not long delay, he will then be unrivalled
in personal endowments by any dog in
this country.”</p>

<p>No wonder the Lichfield Swan was daunted
by the inconceivable popularity of such letters.
No wonder Miss Hannah More preferred Akenside
to Cowper. What had these eloquent
ladies to do with quiet observation, with sober
felicity of phrase, with “the style of honest
men”!</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Readers</span> of Miss Burney’s Diary will remember
her maidenly confusion when Colonel Fairly
(the Honourable Stephen Digby) recommends
to her a novel called “Original Love-Letters
between a Lady of Quality and a Person of Inferior
Station.” The authoress of “Evelina”
and “Cecilia”—then thirty-six years of age—is
embarrassed by the glaring impropriety of
this title. In vain Colonel Fairly assures her
that the book contains “nothing but good sense,
moral reflections, and refined ideas, clothed in
the most expressive and elegant language.”
Fanny, though longing to read a work of such
estimable character, cannot consent to borrow,
or even discuss, anything so compromising as
love-letters; and, with her customary coyness,
murmurs a few words of denial. Colonel Fairly,
however, is not easily daunted. Three days later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
he actually brings the volume to that virginal
bower, and asks permission to read portions of
it aloud, excusing his audacity with the solemn
assurance that there was no person, not even
his own daughter, in whose hands he would
hesitate to place it. “It was now impossible to
avoid saying that I should like to hear it,”
confesses Miss Burney. “I should seem else to
doubt either his taste or his delicacy, while I
have the highest opinion of both.” So the book
is produced, and the fair listener, bending over
her needlework to hide her blushes, acknowledges
it to be “moral, elegant, feeling, and
rational,” while lamenting that the unhappy
nature of its title makes its presence a source
of embarrassment.</p>

<p>This edifying little anecdote sheds light upon
a palmy period of propriety. Miss Burney’s
self-consciousness, her superhuman diffidence,
and the “delicious confusion” which overwhelmed
her upon the most insignificant occasions,
were beacon lights to her “sisters of Parnassus,”
to the less distinguished women who
followed her brilliant lead. The passion for
novel-reading was asserting itself for the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
time in the history of the world as a dominant
note of femininity. The sentimentalities of fiction
expanded to meet the woman’s standard, to
satisfy her irrational demands. “If the story-teller
had always had mere men for an audience,”
says an acute English critic, “there
would have been no romance; nothing but the
improving fable, or the indecent anecdote.” It
was the woman who, as Miss Seward sorrowfully
observed, sucked the “sweet poison”
which the novelist administered; it was the
woman who stooped conspicuously to the “reigning
folly” of the day.</p>

<p>The particular occasion of this outbreak on
Miss Seward’s part was the extraordinary success
of a novel, now long forgotten by the
world, but which in its time rivalled in popularity
“Evelina,” and the well-loved “Mysteries
of Udolpho.” Its plaintive name is “Emmeline;
or the Orphan of the Castle,” and its authoress,
Charlotte Smith, was a woman of courage,
character, and good ability; also of a cheerful
temperament, which we should never have surmised
from her works. It is said that her son
owed his advancement in the East India Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
solely to the admiration felt for “Emmeline,”
which was being read as assiduously in
Bengal as in London. Sir Walter Scott, always
the gentlest of critics, held that it belonged to
the “highest branch of fictitious narrative.”
The Queen, who considered it a masterpiece,
lent it to Miss Burney, who in turn gave it to
Colonel Fairly, who ventured to observe that it
was not “piquant,” and asked for a “Rambler”
instead.</p>

<p>“Emmeline” is <i>not</i> piquant. Its heroine
has more tears than Niobe. “Formed of the
softest elements, and with a mind calculated for
select friendship and domestic happiness,” it is
her misfortune to be loved by all the men she
meets. The “interesting languor” of a countenance
habitually “wet with tears” proves
their undoing. Her “deep convulsive sobs”
charm them more than the laughter of other
maidens. When the orphan leaves the castle
for the first time, she weeps bitterly for an
hour; when she converses with her uncle, she
can “no longer command her tears, sobs
obliged her to cease speaking”; and when he
urges upon her the advantages of a worldly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
marriage, she—as if that were possible—“wept
more than before.” When Delamere,
maddened by rejection, carries her off in a post-chaise
(a delightful frontispiece illustrates this
episode), “a shower of tears fell from her eyes”;
and even a rescue fails to raise her spirits.
Her response to Godolphin’s tenderest approaches
is to “wipe away the involuntary betrayers
of her emotion”; and when he exclaims
in a transport: “Enchanting softness! Is then
the safety of Godolphin so dear to that angelic
bosom?” she answers him with “audible sobs.”</p>

<p>The other characters in the book are nearly
as tearful. When Delamere is not striking his
forehead with his clenched fist, he is weeping
at Emmeline’s feet. The repentant Fitz-Edward
lays his head on a chair, and weeps “like
a woman.” Lady Adelina, who has stooped to
folly, naturally sheds many tears, and writes an
“Ode to Despair”; while Emmeline from time
to time gives “vent to a full heart” by weeping
over Lady Adelina’s infant. Godolphin sobs
loudly when he sees his frail sister; and when
he meets Lord Westhaven after an absence of
four years, “the manly eyes of both brothers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
were filled with tears.” We wonder how Scott,
whose heroines cry so little and whose heroes
never cry at all, stood all this weeping; and,
when we remember the perfunctory nature of
Sir Walter’s love scenes,—wedged in any
way among more important matters,—we wonder
still more how he endured the ravings of
Delamere, or the melancholy verses with which
Godolphin from time to time soothes his despondent
soul.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In deep depression sunk, the enfeebled mind</div>
<div class="indent">Will to the deaf cold elements complain;</div>
<div class="indent">And tell the embosomed grief, however vain,</div>
<div class="verse">To sullen surges and the viewless wind.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was not, however, the mournfulness of
“Emmeline” which displeased Miss Seward,
but rather the occasional intrusion of “low
characters”; of those underbred and unimpassioned
persons who—as in Miss Burney’s and
Miss Ferrier’s novels—are naturally and almost
cheerfully vulgar. That Mr. William
Hayley, author of “The Triumphs of Temper,”
and her own most ardent admirer, should tune
his inconstant lyre in praise of Mrs. Smith was
more than Miss Seward could bear. “My very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
foes acquit me of harbouring one grain of envy
in my bosom,” she writes him feelingly; “yet
it is surely by no means inconsistent with that
exemption to feel a little indignant, and to
enter one’s protest, when compositions of mere
mediocrity are extolled far above those of real
genius.” She then proceeds to point out the
“indelicacy” of Lady Adelina’s fall from grace,
and the use of “kitchen phrases,” such as “she
grew white at the intelligence.” “White instead
of pale,” comments Miss Seward severely,
“I have often heard servants say, but never a
gentleman or a gentlewoman.” If Mr. Hayley
desires to read novels, she urges upon him the
charms of another popular heroine, Caroline de
Lichtfield, in whom he will find “simplicity,
wit, pathos, and the most exalted generosity”;
and the history of whose adventures “makes
curiosity gasp, admiration kindle, and pity dissolve.”</p>

<p>Caroline, “the gay child of Artless Nonchalance,”
is at least a more cheerful young
person than the Orphan. Her story, translated
from the French of Madame de Montolieu,
was widely read in England and on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Continent; and Miss Seward tells us that its
author was indebted “to the merits and graces
of these volumes for a transition from incompetence
to the comforts of wealth; from the
unprotected dependence of waning virginity to
the social pleasures of wedded friendship.” In
plain words, we are given to understand that
a rich and elderly German widower read the
book, sought an acquaintance with the writer,
and married her. “Hymen,” exclaims Miss
Seward, “passed by the fane of Cytherea and
the shrine of Plutus, to light his torch at the
altar of genius”;—which beautiful burst of
eloquence makes it painful to add the chilling
truth, and say that “Caroline de Lichtfield”
was written six years after its author’s marriage
with M. de Montolieu, who was a Swiss, and her
second husband. She espoused her first, M. de
Crousaz, when she was eighteen, and still comfortably
remote from the terrors of waning
virginity. Accurate information was not, however,
a distinguishing characteristic of the day.
Sir Walter Scott, writing some years later of
Madame de Montolieu, ignores both marriages
altogether, and calls her Mademoiselle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>No rich reward lay in wait for poor Charlotte
Smith, whose husband was systematically
impecunious, and whose large family of children
were supported wholly by her pen. “Emmeline,
or the Orphan of the Castle” was followed
by “Ethelinda, or the Recluse of the Lake,” and
that by “The Old Manor House,” which was
esteemed her masterpiece. Its heroine bears the
interesting name of Monimia; and when she
marries her Orlando, “every subsequent hour
of their lives was marked by some act of
benevolence,”—a breathless and philanthropic
career. By this time the false-hearted Hayley
had so far transferred to Mrs. Smith the homage
due to Miss Seward that he was rewarded
with the painful privilege of reading “The
Old Manor House” in manuscript,—a privilege
reserved in those days for tried and patient
friends. The poet had himself dallied a little
with fiction, having written, “solely to promote
the interests of religion,” a novel called “The
Young Widow,” which no one appears to have
read, except perhaps the Archbishop of Canterbury,
to whom its author sent a copy.</p>

<p>In purity of motive Mr. Hayley was rivalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
only by Mrs. Brunton, whose two novels, “Self-Control”
and “Discipline,” were designed “to
procure admission for the religion of a sound
mind and of the Bible where it cannot find access
in any other form.” Mrs. Brunton was perhaps
the most commended novelist of her time.
The inexorable titles of her stories secured for
them a place upon the guarded book-shelves of
the young. Many a demure English girl must
have blessed these deluding titles, just as, forty
years later, many an English boy blessed the
inspiration which had impelled George Borrow
to misname his immortal book “The Bible in
Spain.” When the wife of a clergyman undertook
to write a novel in the interests of religion
and the Scriptures; when she called it
“Discipline,” and drew up a stately apology
for employing fiction as a medium for the lessons
she meant to convey, what parent could
refuse to be beguiled? There is nothing trivial
in Mrs. Brunton’s conception of a good novel,
in the standard she proposes to the world.</p>

<p>“Let the admirable construction of fable in
‘Tom Jones’ be employed to unfold characters
like Miss Edgeworth’s; let it lead to a moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
like Richardson’s; let it be told with the elegance
of Rousseau, and with the simplicity of
Goldsmith; let it be all this, and Milton need
not have been ashamed of the work.”</p>

<p>How far “Discipline” and “Self-Control”
approach this composite standard of perfection
it would be invidious to ask; but they accomplished
a miracle of their own in being both
popular and permitted, in pleasing the frivolous,
and edifying the devout. Dedicated to
Miss Joanna Baillie, sanctioned by Miss Hannah
More, they stood above reproach, though
not without a flavour of depravity. Mrs. Brunton’s
outlook upon life was singularly uncomplicated.
All her women of fashion are heartless
and inane. All her men of fashion cherish
dishonourable designs upon female youth and
innocence. Indeed the strenuous efforts of
Laura, in “Self-Control,” to preserve her virginity
may be thought a trifle explicit for very
youthful readers. We find her in the first
chapter—she is seventeen—fainting at the
feet of her lover, who has just revealed the unworthy
nature of his intentions; and we follow
her through a series of swoons to the last pages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
where she “sinks senseless” into—of all vessels!—a
canoe; and is carried many miles down
a Canadian river in a state of nicely balanced
unconsciousness. Her self-control (the crowning
virtue which gives its title to the book) is
so marked that when she dismisses Hargrave
on probation, and then meets him accidentally
in a London print-shop after a four months’
absence, she “neither screamed nor fainted”;
only “trembled violently, and leant against the
counter to recover strength and composure.”
It is not until he turns, and, “regardless of the
inquisitive looks of the spectators, clasped her
to his breast,” that “her head sunk upon his
shoulder, and she lost all consciousness.” As
for her heroic behaviour when the same Hargrave
(having lapsed from grace) shoots the
virtuous De Courcy in Lady Pelham’s summer-house,
it must be described in the author’s own
words. No others could do it justice.</p>

<p>“To the plants which their beauty had recommended
to Lady Pelham, Laura had added a
few of which the usefulness was known to her.
Agaric of the oak was of the number; and she
had often applied it where many a hand less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
fair would have shrunk from the task. Nor did
she hesitate now. The ball had entered near
the neck; and the feminine, the delicate Laura
herself disengaged the wound from its covering;
the feeling, the tender Laura herself performed
an office from which false sensibility would have
recoiled in horror.”</p>

<p>Is it possible that anybody except Miss Burney
could have shrunk modestly from the sight
of a lover’s neck, especially when it had a bullet
in it? Could a sense of decorum be more overwhelmingly
expressed? Yet the same novel
which held up to our youthful great-grandmothers
this unapproachable standard of propriety
presented to their consideration the most
intimate details of libertinism. There was then,
as now, no escape from the moralist’s devastating
disclosures.</p>

<p>One characteristic is common to all these
faded romances, which in their time were read
with far more fervour and sympathy than are
their successors to-day. This is the undying and
undeviating nature of their heroes’ affections.
Written by ladies who took no count of man’s
proverbial inconstancy, they express a touching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
belief in the supremacy of feminine charms. A
heroine of seventeen (she is seldom older), with
ringlets, and a “faltering timidity,” inflames
both the virtuous and the profligate with such
imperishable passions, that when triumphant
morality leads her to the altar, defeated vice
cannot survive her loss. Her suitors, reversing
the enviable experience of Ben Bolt,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">weep with delight when she gives them a smile,</div>
<div class="indent">And tremble with fear at her frown.</div>
</div></div>

<p>They grow faint with rapture when they enter
her presence, and, when she repels their advances,
they signify their disappointment by
gnashing their teeth, and beating their heads
against the wall. Rejection cannot alienate their
faithful hearts; years and absence cannot chill
their fervour. They belong to a race of men
who, if they ever existed at all, are now as
extinct as the mastodon.</p>

<p>It was Miss Jane Porter who successfully
transferred to a conquering hero that exquisite
sensibility of soul which had erstwhile belonged
to the conquering heroine,—to the Emmelines
and Adelinas of fiction. Dipping her pen “in
the tears of Poland,” she conveyed the glittering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
drops to the eyes of “Thaddeus of Warsaw,”
whence they gush in rills,—like those of
the Prisoner of Chillon’s brother. Thaddeus is of
such exalted virtue that strangers in London address
him as “excellent young gentleman,” and
his friends speak of him as “incomparable young
man.” He rescues children from horses’ hoofs
and from burning buildings. He nurses them
through small-pox, and leaves their bedsides
in the most casual manner, to mingle in crowds
and go to the play. He saves women from insult
on the streets. He is kind even to “that
poor slandered and abused animal, the cat,”—which
is certainly to his credit. Wrapped in a
sable cloak, wearing “hearse-like plumes” on
his hat, a star upon his breast, and a sabre by
his side, he moves with Hamlet’s melancholy
grace through the five hundred pages of the
story. “His unrestrained and elegant conversation
acquired new pathos from the anguish that
was driven back to his heart: like the beds of
rivers which infuse their own nature with the
current, his hidden grief imparted an indescribable
interest and charm to all his sentiments
and actions.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>What wonder that such a youth is passionately
loved by all the women who cross his path,
but whom he regards for the most part with
“that lofty tranquillity which is inseparable
from high rank when it is accompanied by virtue.”
In vain Miss Euphemia Dundas writes
him amorous notes, and entraps him into embarrassing
situations. In vain Lady Sara Roos—married,
I regret to say—pursues him to
his lodgings, and wrings “her snowy arms”
while she confesses the hopeless nature of her
infatuation. The irreproachable Thaddeus replaces
her tenderly but firmly on a sofa, and
as soon as possible sends her home in a cab. It
is only when the “orphan heiress,” Miss Beaufort,
makes her appearance on the scene, “a
large Turkish shawl enveloping her fine form,
a modest grace observable in every limb,” that
the exile’s haughty soul succumbs to love. Miss
Beaufort has been admirably brought up by her
aunt, Lady Somerset, who is a person of great
distinction, and who gives “conversaziones,”
as famous in their way as Mrs. Proudie’s.—“There
the young Mary Beaufort listened to
pious divines of every Christian persuasion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
There she gathered wisdom from real philosophers;
and, in the society of our best living
poets, cherished an enthusiasm for all that is
great and good. On these evenings, Sir Robert
Somerset’s house reminded the visitor of
what he had read or imagined of the School of
Athens.”</p>

<p>Never do hero and heroine approach each
other with such spasms of modesty as Thaddeus
and Miss Beaufort. Their hearts expand with
emotion, but their mutual sense of propriety
keeps them remote from all vulgar understandings.
In vain “Mary’s rosy lips seemed to
breathe balm while she spoke.” In vain “her
beautiful eyes shone with benevolence.” The
exile, standing proudly aloof, watches with bitter
composure the attentions of more frivolous
suitors. “His arms were folded, his hat pulled
over his forehead; and his long dark eye-lashes
shading his downcast eyes imparted a dejection
to his whole air, which wrapped her weeping
heart round and round with regretful pangs.”
What with his lashes, and his hidden griefs,
the majesty of his mournful moods, and the
pleasing pensiveness of his lighter ones, Thaddeus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
so far eclipses his English rivals that they
may be pardoned for wishing he had kept his
charms in Poland. Who that has read the
matchless paragraph which describes the first
unveiling of the hero’s symmetrical leg can forget
the sensation it produces?</p>

<p>“Owing to the warmth of the weather, Thaddeus
came out this morning without boots; and
it being the first time the exquisite proportion
of his limb had been seen by any of the present
company excepting Euphemia” (why had Euphemia
been so favoured?), “Lascelles, bursting
with an emotion which he would not call
envy, measured the count’s fine leg with his
scornful eye.”</p>

<p>When Thaddeus at last expresses his attachment
for Miss Beaufort, he does so kneeling respectfully
in her uncle’s presence, and in these
well-chosen words: “Dearest Miss Beaufort,
may I indulge myself in the idea that I am
blessed with your esteem?” Whereupon Mary
whispers to Sir Robert: “Pray, Sir, desire
him to rise. I am already sufficiently overwhelmed!”
and the solemn deed is done.</p>

<p>“Thaddeus of Warsaw” may be called the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
“Last of the Heroes,” and take rank with the
“Last of the Mohicans,” the “Last of the
Barons,” the “Last of the Cavaliers,” and all
the finalities of fiction. With him died that
noble race who expressed our great-grandmothers’
artless ideals of perfection. Seventy
years later, D’Israeli made a desperate effort
to revive a pale phantom of departed glory
in “Lothair,” that nursling of the gods, who
is emphatically a hero, and nothing more.
“London,” we are gravely told, “was at Lothair’s
feet.” He is at once the hope of United
Italy, and the bulwark of the English Establishment.
He is—at twenty-two—the pivot
of fashionable, political, and clerical diplomacy.
He is beloved by the female aristocracy
of Great Britain; and mysterious ladies, whose
lofty souls stoop to no conventionalities, die
happy with his kisses on their lips. Five hundred
mounted gentlemen compose his simple
country escort, and the coat of his groom of
the chambers is made in Saville Row. What
more could a hero want? What more could be
lavished upon him by the most indulgent of
authors? Yet who shall compare Lothair to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the noble Thaddeus nodding his hearse-like
plumes,—Thaddeus dedicated to the “urbanity
of the brave,” and embalmed in the tears of
Poland? The inscrutable creator of Lothair
presented his puppet to a mocking world; but
all England and much of the Continent dilated
with correct emotions when Thaddeus, “uniting
to the courage of a man the sensibility of a
woman, and the exalted goodness of an angel”
(I quote from an appreciative critic), knelt at
Miss Beaufort’s feet.</p>

<p>Ten years later “Pride and Prejudice” made
its unobtrusive appearance, and was read by
that “saving remnant” to whom is confided
the intellectual welfare of their land. Mrs. Elwood,
the biographer of England’s “Literary
Ladies,” tells us, in the few careless pages
which she deems sufficient for Miss Austen’s
novels, that there <i>are</i> people who think these
stories “worthy of ranking with those of Madame
d’Arblay and Miss Edgeworth”; but that
in their author’s estimation (and, by inference,
in her own), “they took up a much more humble
station.” Yet, tolerant even of such inferiority,
Mrs. Elwood bids us remember that although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
“the character of Emma is perhaps too
manœuvring and too plotting to be perfectly
amiable,” that of Catherine Morland “will not
suffer greatly even from a comparison with
Miss Burney’s interesting Evelina”; and that
“although one is occasionally annoyed by the
underbred personages of Miss Austen’s novels,
the annoyance is only such as we should feel if
we were actually in their company.”</p>

<p>It was thus that our genteel great-grandmothers,
enamoured of lofty merit and of refined
sensibility, regarded Elizabeth Bennet’s
relations.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ON THE SLOPES OF PARNASSUS</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Perhaps no man ever thought a line superfluous when
he wrote it. We are seldom tiresome to ourselves.—<span class="smcap">Dr.
Johnson.</span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is commonly believed that the extinction of
verse—of verse in the bulk, which is the way
in which our great-grandfathers consumed it—is
due to the vitality of the novel. People,
we are told, read rhyme and metre with docility,
only because they wanted to hear a story,
only because there was no other way in which
they could get plenty of sentiment and romance.
As soon as the novel supplied them
with all the sentiment they wanted, as soon as
it told them the story in plain prose, they
turned their backs upon poetry forever.</p>

<p>There is a transparent inadequacy in this
solution of a problem which still confronts the
patient reader of buried masterpieces. Novels
were plenty when Mr. William Hayley’s
“Triumphs of Temper” went through twelve
editions, and when Dr. Darwin’s “Botanic
Garden” was received with deferential delight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
But could any dearth of fiction persuade
us now to read the “Botanic Garden”?
Were we shipwrecked in company with the
“Triumphs of Temper,” would we ever finish
the first canto? Novels stood on every English
book-shelf when Fox read “Madoc” aloud at
night to his friends, and they stayed up, so he
says, an hour after their bedtime to hear it.
Could that miracle be worked to-day? Sir
Walter Scott, with indestructible amiability,
reread “Madoc” to please Miss Seward, who,
having “steeped” her own eyes “in transports
of tears and sympathy,” wrote to him that it
carried “a master-key to every bosom which
common good sense and anything resembling
a human heart inhabit.” Scott, unwilling to
resign all pretensions to a human heart, tried
hard to share the Swan’s emotions, and failed.
“I cannot feel quite the interest I would like
to do,” he patiently confessed.</p>

<p>If Southey’s poems were not read as Scott’s
and Moore’s and Byron’s were read (give us
another Byron, and we will read him with forty
thousand novels knocking at our doors!); if
they were not paid for out of the miraculous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
depths of Murray’s Fortunatus’s purse, they
nevertheless enjoyed a solid reputation of their
own. They are mentioned in all the letters of
the period (save and except Lord Byron’s
ribald pages) with carefully measured praise,
and they enabled their author to accept the
laureateship on self-respecting terms. They are
at least, as Sir Leslie Stephen reminds us, more
readable than Glover’s “Leonidas,” or Wilkie’s
“Epigoniad,” and they are shorter, too. Yet
the “Leonidas,” an epic in nine books, went
through four editions; whereupon its elate
author expanded it into twelve books; and the
public, undaunted, kept on buying it for years.
The “Epigoniad” is also in nine books. It is
on record that Hume, who seldom dallied with
the poets, read all nine, and praised them
warmly. Mr. Wilkie was christened the “Scottish
Homer,” and he bore that modest title
until his death. It was the golden age of epics.
The ultimatum of the modern publisher, “No
poet need apply!” had not yet blighted the
hopes and dimmed the lustre of genius. “Everybody
thinks he can write verse,” observed Sir
Walter mournfully, when called upon for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
hundredth time to help a budding aspirant to
fame.</p>

<p>With so many competitors in the field, it
was uncommonly astute in Mr. Hayley to
address himself exclusively to that sex which
poets and orators call “fair.” There is a
formal playfulness, a ponderous vivacity about
the “Triumphs of Temper,” which made it
especially welcome to women. In the preface
of the first edition the author gallantly laid
his laurels at their feet, observing modestly
that it was his desire, however “ineffectual,”
“to unite the sportive wildness of Ariosto and
the more serious sublime painting of Dante
with some portion of the enchanting elegance,
the refined imagination, and the moral graces
of Pope; and to do this, if possible, without
violating those rules of propriety which Mr.
Cambridge has illustrated, by example as well
as by precept, in the ‘Scribleriad,’ and in his
sensible preface to that elegant and learned
poem.”</p>

<p>Accustomed as we are to the confusions of
literary perspective, this grouping of Dante,
Ariosto, and Mr. Cambridge does seem a trifle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
foreshortened. But our ancestors had none
of that sensitive shrinking from comparisons
which is so characteristic of our timid and
thin-skinned generation. They did not edge
off from the immortals, afraid to breathe their
names lest it be held lèse-majesté; they used
them as the common currency of criticism.
Why should not Mr. Hayley have challenged
a contrast with Dante and Ariosto, when Miss
Seward assured her little world—which was
also Mr. Hayley’s world—that he had the
“wit and ease” of Prior, a “more varied versification”
than Pope, and “the fire and the
invention of Dryden, without any of Dryden’s
absurdity”? Why should he have questioned
her judgment, when she wrote to him that
Cowper’s “Task” would “please and instruct
the race of common readers,” who could not
rise to the beauties of Akenside, or Mason, or
Milton, or of his (Mr. Hayley’s) “exquisite
‘Triumphs of Temper’”? There was a time,
indeed, when she sorrowed lest his “inventive,
classical, and elegant muse” should be “deplorably
infected” by the growing influence
of Wordsworth; but, that peril past, he rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
again, the bright particular star of a wide
feminine horizon.</p>

<p>Mr. Hayley’s didacticism is admirably
adapted to his readers. The men of the
eighteenth century were not expected to keep
their tempers; it was the sweet prerogative of
wives and daughters to smooth the roughened
current of family life. Accordingly the heroine
of the “Triumphs,” being bullied by her father,
a fine old gentleman of the Squire Western type,
maintains a superhuman cheerfulness, gives
up the ball for which she is already dressed,
wreathes her countenance in smiles, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent10">
with sportive ease,</div>
<div class="verse">Prest her Piano-forte’s favourite keys.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The men of the eighteenth century were all
hard drinkers. Therefore Mr. Hayley conjures
the “gentle fair” to avoid even the mild debauchery
of siruped fruits,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">For the sly fiend, of every art possest,</div>
<div class="verse">Steals on th’ affection of her female guest;</div>
<div class="verse">And, by her soft address, seducing each,</div>
<div class="verse">Eager she plies them with a brandy peach.</div>
<div class="verse">They with keen lip the luscious fruit devour,</div>
<div class="verse">But swiftly feel its peace-destroying power.</div>
<div class="verse">Quick through each vein new tides of frenzy roll,</div>
<div class="verse">All evil passions kindle in the soul;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
<div class="verse">Drive from each feature every cheerful grace,</div>
<div class="verse">And glare ferocious in the sallow face;</div>
<div class="verse">The wounded nerves in furious conflict tear,</div>
<div class="verse">Then sink in blank dejection and despair.</div>
</div></div>

<p>All this combustle, to use Gray’s favourite word,
about a brandy peach! But women have ever
loved to hear their little errors magnified. In
the matter of poets, preachers and confessors,
they are sure to choose the denunciatory.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin, as became a scientist and a
sceptic, addressed his ponderous “Botanic
Garden” to male readers. It is true that he
offers much good advice to women, urging
upon them especially those duties and devotions
from which he, as a man, was exempt.
It is true also that when he first contemplated
writing his epic, he asked Miss Seward—so,
at least, she said—to be his collaborator; an
honour which she modestly declined, as not
“strictly proper for a female pen.” But the
peculiar solidity, the encyclopædic qualities of
this masterpiece, fitted it for such grave students
as Mr. Edgeworth, who loved to be
amply instructed. It is a poem replete with
information, and information of that disconnected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
order in which the Edgeworthian soul
took true delight. We are told, not only about
flowers and vegetables, but about electric fishes,
and the salt mines of Poland; about Dr. Franklin’s
lightning rod, and Mrs. Damer’s bust of
the Duchess of Devonshire; about the treatment
of paralytics, and the mechanism of the
common pump. We pass from the death of
General Wolfe at Quebec to the equally lamented
demise of a lady botanist at Derby.
We turn from the contemplation of Hannibal
crossing the Alps to consider the charities of
a benevolent young woman named Jones.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Sound, Nymphs of Helicon! the trump of Fame,</div>
<div class="verse">And teach Hibernian echoes Jones’s name;</div>
<div class="verse">Bind round her polished brow the civic bay,</div>
<div class="verse">And drag the fair Philanthropist to day.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Pagan divinities disport themselves on one page,
and Christian saints on another. St. Anthony
preaches, not to the little fishes of the brooks
and streams, but to the monsters of the deep,—sharks,
porpoises, whales, seals and dolphins,
that assemble in a sort of aquatic camp-meeting
on the shores of the Adriatic, and “get
religion” in the true revivalist spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The listening shoals the quick contagion feel,</div>
<div class="verse">Pant on the floods, inebriate with their zeal;</div>
<div class="verse">Ope their wide jaws, and bow their slimy heads,</div>
<div class="verse">And dash with frantic fins their foamy beds.</div>
</div></div>

<p>For a freethinker, Dr. Darwin is curiously
literal in his treatment of hagiology and the
Scriptures. His Nebuchadnezzar (introduced as
an illustration of the “Loves of the Plants”)
is not a bestialized mortal, but a veritable beast,
like one of Circe’s swine, only less easily classified
in natural history.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Long eagle plumes his arching neck invest,</div>
<div class="verse">Steal round his arms and clasp his sharpened breast;</div>
<div class="verse">Dark brindled hairs in bristling ranks behind,</div>
<div class="verse">Rise o’er his back and rustle in the wind;</div>
<div class="verse">Clothe his lank sides, his shrivelled limbs surround,</div>
<div class="verse">And human hands with talons print the ground.</div>
<div class="verse">Lolls his red tongue, and from the reedy side</div>
<div class="verse">Of slow Euphrates laps the muddy tide.</div>
<div class="verse">Silent, in shining troups, the Courtier throng</div>
<div class="verse">Pursue their monarch as he crawls along;</div>
<div class="verse">E’en Beauty pleads in vain with smiles and tears,</div>
<div class="verse">Not Flattery’s self can pierce his pendant ears.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The picture of the embarrassed courtiers promenading
slowly after this royal phenomenon,
and of the lovely inconsiderates proffering their
vain allurements, is so ludicrous as to be painful.
Even Miss Seward, who held that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
“Botanic Garden” combined “the sublimity of
Michael Angelo, the correctness and elegance
of Raphael, with the glow of Titian,” was
shocked by Nebuchadnezzar’s pendant ears, and
admitted that the passage was likely to provoke
inconsiderate laughter.</p>

<p>The first part of Dr. Darwin’s poem, “The
Economy of Vegetation,” was warmly praised
by critics and reviewers. Its name alone secured
for it esteem. A few steadfast souls, like
Mrs. Schimmelpenninck, refused to accept even
vegetation from a sceptic’s hands; but it was
generally conceded that the poet had “entwined
the Parnassian laurel with the balm of Pharmacy”
in a very creditable manner. The last
four cantos, however,—indiscreetly entitled
“The Loves of the Plants,”—awakened grave
concern. They were held unfit for female youth,
which, being then taught driblets of science in
a guarded and muffled fashion, was not supposed
to know that flowers had any sex, much
less that they practised polygamy. The glaring
indiscretion of their behaviour in the “Botanic
Garden,” their seraglios, their amorous
embraces and involuntary libertinism, offended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
British decorum, and, what was worse, exposed
the poem to Canning’s pungent ridicule. When
the “Loves of the Triangles” appeared in the
“Anti-Jacobin,” all England—except Whigs
and patriots who never laughed at Canning’s
jokes—was moved to inextinguishable mirth.
The mock seriousness of the introduction and
argument, the “horrid industry” of the notes,
the contrast between the pensiveness of the Cycloid
and the innocent playfulness of the Pendulum,
the solemn headshake over the licentious
disposition of Optics, and the description
of the three Curves that requite the passion of
the Rectangle, all burlesque with unfeeling
delight Dr. Darwin’s ornate pedantry.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Let shrill Acoustics tune the tiny lyre,</div>
<div class="verse">With Euclid sage fair Algebra conspire;</div>
<div class="verse">Let Hydrostatics, simpering as they go,</div>
<div class="verse">Lead the light Naiads on fantastic toe.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The indignant poet, frigidly vain, and immaculately
free from any taint of humour, was
as much scandalized as hurt by this light-hearted
mockery. Being a dictator in his own little
circle at Derby, he was naturally disposed to
consider the “Anti-Jacobin” a menace to genius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and to patriotism. His criticisms and his prescriptions
had hitherto been received with equal
submission. When he told his friends that
Akenside was a better poet than Milton,—“more
polished, pure, and dignified,” they listened
with respect. When he told his patients
to eat acid fruits with plenty of sugar and
cream, they obeyed with alacrity. He had a
taste for inventions, and first made Mr. Edgeworth’s
acquaintance by showing him an ingenious
carriage of his own contrivance, which
was designed to facilitate the movements of the
horse, and enable it to turn with ease. The
fact that Dr. Darwin was three times thrown
from this vehicle, and that the third accident
lamed him for life, in no way disconcerted the
inventor or his friends, who loved mechanism
for its own sake, and apart from any given results.
Dr. Darwin defined a fool as one who
never in his life tried an experiment. So did
Mr. Day, of “Sandford and Merton” fame,
who experimented in the training of animals,
and was killed by an active young colt that had
failed to grasp the system.</p>

<p>The “Botanic Garden” was translated into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
French, Italian, and Portuguese, to the great
relief of Miss Seward, who hated to think that
the immortality of such a work depended upon
the preservation of a single tongue. “Should
that tongue perish,” she wrote proudly, “translations
would at least retain all the host of
beauties which do not depend upon felicities
of verbal expression.”</p>

<p>If the interminable epics which were so
popular in these halcyon days had condescended
to the telling of stories, we might believe that
they were read, or at least occasionally read, as
a substitute for prose fiction. But the truth is
that most of them are solid treatises on morality,
or agriculture, or therapeutics, cast into
the blankest of blank verse, and valued, presumably,
for the sake of the information they
conveyed. Their very titles savour of statement
rather than of inspiration. Nobody in search
of romance would take up Dr. Grainger’s
“Sugar Cane,” or Dyer’s “Fleece,” or the
Rev. Richard Polwhele’s “English Orator.”
Nobody desiring to be idly amused would read
the “Vales of Weaver,” or a long didactic
poem on “The Influence of Local Attachment.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
It was not because he felt himself to
be a poet that Dr. Grainger wrote the “Sugar
Cane” in verse, but because that was the form
most acceptable to the public. The ever famous
line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Now Muse, let’s sing of rats!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>which made merry Sir Joshua Reynolds and
his friends, is indicative of the good doctor’s
struggles to employ an uncongenial medium.
He wanted to tell his readers how to farm successfully
in the West Indies; how to keep well
in a treacherous climate; what food to eat, what
drugs to take, how to look after the physical
condition of negro servants, and guard them
from prevalent maladies. These were matters
on which the author was qualified to speak, and
on which he does speak with all a physician’s
frankness; but they do not lend themselves to
lofty strains. Whole pages of the “Sugar
Cane” read like prescriptions and dietaries
done into verse. It is as difficult to sing
with dignity about a disordered stomach as
about rats and cockroaches; and Dr. Grainger’s
determination to leave nothing untold
leads him to dwell with much feeling, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
little grace, on all the disadvantages of the
tropics.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Musquitoes, sand-flies, seek the sheltered roof,</div>
<div class="verse">And with fell rage the stranger guest assail,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor spare the sportive child; from their retreats</div>
<div class="verse">Cockroaches crawl displeasingly abroad.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The truthfulness and sobriety of this last line
deserve commendation. Cockroaches in the
open <i>are</i> displeasing to sensitive souls; and a
footnote, half a page long, tells us everything
we could possibly desire—or fear—to know
about these insects. As an example of Dr.
Grainger’s thoroughness in the treatment of
such themes, I quote with delight his approved
method of poisoning alligators.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">With Misnian arsenic, deleterious bane,</div>
<div class="verse">Pound up the ripe cassada’s well-rasped root,</div>
<div class="verse">And form in pellets; these profusely spread</div>
<div class="verse">Round the Cane-groves where skulk the vermin-breed.</div>
<div class="verse">They, greedy, and unweeting of the bait,</div>
<div class="verse">Crowd to the inviting cates, and swift devour</div>
<div class="verse">Their palatable Death; for soon they seek</div>
<div class="verse">The neighbouring spring; and drink, and swell, and die.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then follow some very sensible remarks about
the unwholesomeness of the water in which the
dead alligators are decomposing,—remarks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
which Mr. Kipling has unconsciously parodied:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">But ’e gets into the drinking casks, and then o’ course we dies.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The wonderful thing about the “Sugar Cane”
is that it was read;—nay, more, that
it was read aloud at the house of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, and though the audience laughed, it
listened. Dodsley published the poem in handsome
style; a second edition was called for; it
was reprinted in Jamaica, and pirated (what
were the pirates thinking about!) in 1766.
Even Dr. Johnson wrote a friendly notice in
the London “Chronicle,” though he always
maintained that the poet might just as well
have sung the beauties of a parsley-bed or of a
cabbage garden. He took the same high ground
when Boswell called his attention to Dyer’s
“Fleece.”—“The subject, Sir, cannot be
made poetical. How can a man write poetically
of serges and druggets?”</p>

<p>It was not for the sake of sentiment or story
that the English public read “The Fleece.”
Nor could it have been for practical guidance;
for farmers, even in 1757, must have had some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
musty almanacs, some plain prose manuals to
advise them. They could never have waited to
learn from an epic poem that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent13">the coughing pest</div>
<div class="verse">From their green pastures sweeps whole flocks away,</div>
</div></div>

<p>or that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Sheep also pleurisies and dropsies know,</div>
</div></div>

<p>or that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The infectious scab, arising from extremes</div>
<div class="verse">Of want or surfeit, is by water cured</div>
<div class="verse">Of lime, or sodden stave-acre, or oil</div>
<div class="verse">Dispersive of Norwegian tar.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Did the British woolen-drapers of the period
require to be told in verse about</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Cheyney, and bayse, and serge, and alepine,</div>
<div class="verse">Tammy, and crape, and the long countless list</div>
<div class="verse">Of woolen webs.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Surely they knew more about their own dry-goods
than did Mr. Dyer. Is it possible that
British parsons read Mr. Polwhele’s “English
Orator” for the sake of his somewhat confused
advice to preachers?—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Meantime thy Style familiar, that alludes</div>
<div class="verse">With pleasing Retrospect to recent Scenes</div>
<div class="verse">Or Incidents amidst thy Flock, fresh graved</div>
<div class="verse">On Memory, shall recall their scattered Thoughts,</div>
<div class="verse">And interest every Bosom. With the Voice</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
<div class="verse">Of condescending Gentleness address</div>
<div class="verse">Thy kindred People.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was Miss Seward’s opinion that the neglect
of Mr. Polwhele’s “poetic writings” was
a disgrace to literary England, from which we
conclude that the reverend author outwore the
patience of his readers. “Mature in dulness
from his earliest years,” he had wisely adopted
a profession which gave his qualities room for
expansion. What his congregation must have
suffered when he addressed it with “condescending
gentleness,” we hardly like to think;
but free-born Englishmen, who were so fortunate
as not to hear him, refused to make good
their loss by reading the “English Orator,”
even after it had been revised by a bishop.
Miss Seward praised it highly; in return for
which devotion she was hailed as a “Parnassian
sister” in six benedictory stanzas.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Still gratitude her stores among,</div>
<div class="indent">Shall bid the plausive poet sing;</div>
<div class="verse">And, if the last of all the throng</div>
<div class="indent">That rise on the poetic wing,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet not regardless of his destined way,</div>
<div class="verse">If Seward’s envied sanction stamps the lay.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The Swan, indeed, was never without admirers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Her “Louisa; a Poetical Novel in four
Epistles,” was favourably noticed; Dr. Johnson
praised her ode on the death of Captain
Cook; and no contributor to the Bath Easton
vase received more myrtle wreaths than she
did. “Warble” was the word commonly used
by partial critics in extolling her verse. “Long
may she continue to warble as heretofore, in
such numbers as few even of our favourite
bards would be shy to own.” Scott sorrowfully
admitted to Miss Baillie that he found these
warblings—of which he was the reluctant editor—“execrable”;
and that the despair which
filled his soul on receiving Miss Seward’s letters
gave him a lifelong horror of sentiment;
but for once it is impossible to sympathize
with Sir Walter’s sufferings. If he had never
praised the verses, he would never have been
called upon to edit them; and James Ballantyne
would have been saved the printing of an
unsalable book. There is no lie so little worth
the telling as that which is spoken in pure
kindness to spare a wholesome pang.</p>

<p>It was, however, the pleasant custom of the
time to commend and encourage female poets, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
we commend and encourage a child’s unsteady
footsteps. The generous Hayley welcomed with
open arms these fair competitors for fame.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The bards of Britain with unjaundiced eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Will glory to behold such rivals rise.</div>
</div></div>

<p>He ardently flattered Miss Seward, and for
Miss Hannah More his enthusiasm knew no
bounds.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">But with a magical control,</div>
<div class="indent">Thy spirit-moving strain</div>
<div class="verse">Dispels the languor of the soul,</div>
<div class="indent">Annihilating pain.</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Spirit-moving” seems the last epithet in the
world to apply to Miss More’s strains; but
there is no doubt that the public believed her
to be as good a poet as a preacher, and that it
supported her high estimate of her own powers.
After a visit to another lambent flame, Mrs.
Barbauld, she writes with irresistible gravity:</p>

<p>“Mrs. B. and I have found out that we feel
as little envy and malice towards each other,
as though we had neither of us attempted to
‘build the lofty rhyme’; although she says
this is what the envious and the malicious can
never be brought to believe.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Think of the author of “The Search after
Happiness” and the author of “A Poetical
Epistle to Mr. Wilberforce” loudly refusing to
envy each other’s eminence! There is nothing
like it in the strife-laden annals of fame.</p>

<p>Finally there stepped into the arena that
charming embodiment of the female muse, Mrs.
Hemans; and the manly heart of Protestant
England warmed into homage at her shrine.
From the days she “first carolled forth her
poetic talents under the animating influence
of an affectionate and admiring circle,” to the
days when she faded gracefully out of life, her
“half-etherealized spirit” rousing itself to dictate
a last “Sabbath Sonnet,” she was crowned
and garlanded with bays. In the first place, she
was fair to see,—Fletcher’s bust shows real
loveliness; and it was Christopher North’s
opinion that “no really ugly woman ever wrote
a truly beautiful poem the length of her little
finger.” In the second place, she was sincerely
pious; and the Ettrick Shepherd reflected the
opinion of his day when he said that “without
religion, a woman’s just an even-down deevil.”
The appealing helplessness of Mrs. Hemans’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
gentle and affectionate nature, the narrowness
of her sympathies, and the limitations of her
art were all equally acceptable to critics like
Gifford and Jeffrey, who held strict views as
to the rounding of a woman’s circle. Even
Byron heartily approved of a pious and pretty
woman writing pious and pretty poems. Even
Wordsworth flung her lordly words of praise.
Even Shelley wrote her letters so eager and
ardent that her very sensible mamma, Mrs.
Browne, requested him to cease. And as for
Scott, though he confessed she was too poetical
for his taste, he gave her always the honest
friendship she deserved. It was to her he said,
when some tourists left them hurriedly at Newark
Tower: “Ah, Mrs. Hemans, they little
know what two lions they are running away
from.” It was to her he said, when she was
leaving Abbotsford: “There are some whom
we meet, and should like ever after to claim as
kith and kin; and you are of this number.”</p>

<p>Who would not gladly have written “The
Siege of Valencia” and “The Vespers of Palermo,”
to have heard Sir Walter say these
words?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LITERARY LADY</h2>
</div>



<p class="center">Out-pensioners of Parnassus.—<span class="smcap">Horace Walpole.</span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this overrated century of progress, when
women have few favours shown them, but are
asked to do their work or acknowledge their
deficiencies, the thoughtful mind turns disconsolately
back to those urbane days when every
tottering step they took was patronized and
praised. It must have been very pleasant to be
able to publish “Paraphrases and Imitations
of Horace,” without knowing a word of Latin.
Latin is a difficult language to study, and much
useful time may be wasted in acquiring it; therefore
Miss Anna Seward eschewed the tedious
process which most translators deem essential.
Yet her paraphrases were held to have caught
the true Horatian spirit; and critics praised
them all the more indulgently because of their
author’s feminine attitude to the classics.
“Over the lyre of Horace,” she wrote elegantly
to Mr. Repton, “I throw an unfettered hand.”</p>

<p>It may be said that critics were invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
indulgent to female writers (listen to Christopher
North purring over Mrs. Hemans!) until
they stepped, like Charlotte Brontë, from their
appointed spheres, and hotly challenged the
competition of the world. This was a disagreeable
and a disconcerting thing for them to do.
Nobody could patronize “Jane Eyre,” and none
of the pleasant things which were habitually
murmured about “female excellence and talent”
seemed to fit this firebrand of a book. Had
Charlotte Brontë taken to heart Mrs. King’s
“justly approved work” on “The Beneficial
Effects of the Christian Temper upon Domestic
Happiness,” she would not have shocked and
pained the sensitive reviewer of the “Quarterly.”</p>

<p>It was in imitation of that beacon light, Miss
Hannah More, that Mrs. King wrote her
famous treatise. It was in imitation of Miss
Hannah More that Mrs. Trimmer (abhorred by
Lamb) wrote “The Servant’s Friend,” “Help
to the Unlearned,” and the “Charity School
Spelling Book,”—works which have passed out
of the hands of men, but whose titles survive to
fill us with wonder and admiration. Was there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
ever a time when the unlearned frankly recognized
their ignorance, and when a mistress
ventured to give her housemaids a “Servant’s
Friend”? Was spelling in the charity schools
different from spelling elsewhere, or were
charity-school children taught a limited vocabulary,
from which all words of rank had been
eliminated? Those were days when the upper
classes were affable and condescending, when
the rural poor—if not intoxicated—curtsied
and invoked blessings on their benefactors all
day long, and when benevolent ladies told the
village politicians what it was well for them to
know. But even at this restful period, a
“Charity School Spelling Book” seems ill calculated
to inspire the youthful student with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimmer’s attitude to the public was
marked by that refined diffidence which was
considered becoming in a female. Her biographer
assures us that she never coveted literary
distinction, although her name was celebrated
“wherever Christianity was established, and the
English language was spoken.” Royalty took
her by the hand, and bishops expressed their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
overwhelming sense of obligation. We sigh to
think how many ladies became famous against
their wills a hundred and fifty years ago, and
how hard it is now to raise our aspiring heads.
There was Miss —— or, as she preferred to be
called, Mrs. —— Carter, who read Greek, and
translated Epictetus, who was admired by “the
great, the gay, the good, and the learned”; yet
who could with difficulty be persuaded to bear
the burden of her own eminence. It was the
opinion of her friends that Miss Carter had
conferred a good deal of distinction upon Epictetus
by her translation,—by setting, as Dr.
Young elegantly phrased it, this Pagan jewel
in gold. We find Mrs. Montagu writing to this
effect, and expressing in round terms her sense
of the philosopher’s obligation. “Might not
such an honour from a fair hand make even an
Epictetus proud, without being censured for it?
Nor let Mrs. Carter’s amiable modesty become
blameable by taking offence at the truth, but
stand the shock of applause which she has
brought upon her own head.”</p>

<p>It was very comforting to receive letters like
this, to be called upon to brace one’s self against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the shock of applause, instead of against the
chilly douche of disparagement. Miss Carter
retorted, as in duty bound, by imploring her
friend to employ her splendid abilities upon
some epoch-making work,—some work which,
while it entertained the world, “would be applauded
by angels, and registered in Heaven.”
Perhaps the uncertainty of angelic readers
daunted even Mrs. Montagu, for she never responded
to this and many similar appeals; but
suffered her literary reputation to rest secure
on her defence of Shakespeare, and three papers
contributed to Lord Lyttelton’s “Dialogues of
the Dead.” Why, indeed, should she have laboured
further, when, to the end of her long and
honoured life, men spoke of her “transcendent
talents,” her “magnificent attainments”?
Had she written a history of the world, she
could not have been more reverently praised.
Lord Lyttelton, transported with pride at having
so distinguished a collaborator, wrote to her
that the French translation of the “Dialogues”
was as well done as “the poverty of the French
tongue would permit”; and added unctuously,
“but such eloquence as yours must lose by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
being translated into <i>any</i> other language. Your
form and manner would seduce Apollo himself
on his throne of criticism on Parnassus.”</p>

<p>Lord Lyttelton was perhaps more remarkable
for amiability than for judgment; but Sir
Nathaniel Wraxall, who wrote good letters himself,
ardently admired Mrs. Montagu’s, and
pronounced her “the Madame du Deffand of
the English capital.” Cowper meekly admitted
that she stood at the head “of all that is called
learned,” and that every critic “veiled his bonnet
before her superior judgment.” Even Dr.
Johnson, though he despised the “Dialogues,”
and protested to the end of his life that Shakespeare
stood in no need of Mrs. Montagu’s
championship, acknowledged that the lady was
well informed and intelligent. “Conversing
with her,” he said, “you may find variety in
one”; and this charming phrase stands now as
the most generous interpretation of her fame.
It is something we can credit amid the bewildering
nonsense which was talked and written
about a woman whose hospitality dazzled
society, and whose assertiveness dominated her
friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>There were other literary ladies belonging to
this charmed circle whose reputations rested
on frailer foundations. Mrs. Montagu <i>did</i>
write the essay on Shakespeare and the three
dialogues. Miss Carter <i>did</i> translate Epictetus.
Mrs. Chapone <i>did</i> write “Letters on the
Improvement of the Mind,” which so gratified
George the Third and Queen Charlotte that
they entreated her to compose a second volume;
and she <i>did</i> dally a little with verse, for one of
her odes was prefixed—Heaven knows why!—to
Miss Carter’s “Epictetus”; and the
Prince of Wales, the Duke of York, even little
Prince William, were all familiar with this
masterpiece. There never was a lady more
popular with a reigning house, and, when we
dip into her pages, we know the reason why.
A firm insistence upon admitted truths, a loving
presentation of the obvious, a generous
championship of those sweet commonplaces we
all deem dignified and safe, made her especially
pleasing to good King George and his consort.
Even her letters are models of sapiency. “Tho’
I meet with no absolutely perfect character,”
she writes to Sir William Pepys, “yet where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
I find a good disposition, improved by good
principles and virtuous habits, I feel a moral
assurance that I shall not find any flagrant
vices in the same person, and that I shall never
see him fall into any very criminal action.”</p>

<p>The breadth and tolerance of this admission
must have startled her correspondent, seasoned
though he was to intellectual audacity. Nor
was Mrs. Chapone lacking in the gentle art of
self-advancement; for, when about to publish a
volume of “Miscellanies,” she requested Sir
William to write an essay on “Affection and
Simplicity,” or “Enthusiasm and Indifference,”
and permit her to print it as her own.
“If your ideas suit my way of thinking,” she
tells him encouragingly, “I can cool them
down to my manner of writing, for we must
not have a hotchpotch of Styles; and if, for
any reason, I should not be able to make use
of them, you will still have had the benefit of
having written them, and may peaceably possess
your own property.”</p>

<p>There are many ways of asking a favour; but
to assume that you are granting the favour
that you ask shows spirit and invention. Had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Mrs. Chapone written nothing but this model
of all begging letters, she would be worthy to
take high rank among the literary ladies of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to establish the claim of
Mrs. Boscawen, who looms nebulously on the
horizon as the wife of an admiral, and the
friend of Miss Hannah More, from whom she
received flowing compliments in the “Bas
Bleu.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Each art of conversation knowing,</div>
<div class="verse">High-bred, elegant Boscawen.</div>
</div></div>

<p>We are told that this lady was “distinguished
by the strength of her understanding, the
poignancy of her humour, and the brilliancy of
her wit”; but there does not survive the mildest
joke, the smallest word of wisdom to illustrate
these qualities. Then there was Mrs. Schimmelpenninck,
whose name alone was a guarantee
of immortality; and the “sprightly and pleasing
Mrs. Ironmonger”; and Miss Lee, who
could repeat the whole of Miss Burney’s “Cecilia”
(a shocking accomplishment); and the
vivacious Miss Monckton, whom Johnson called
a dunce; and Miss Elizabeth Hamilton, a useful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
person, “equally competent to form the
minds and manners of the daughters of a nobleman,
and to reform the simple but idle
habits of the peasantry”; and Mrs. Bennet,
whose letters—so Miss Seward tells us—“breathed
Ciceronean spirit and eloquence,”
and whose poems revealed “the terse neatness,
humour, and gayety of Swift,” which makes
it doubly distressful that neither letters nor
poems have survived. Above all, there was the
mysterious “Sylph,” who glides—sylphlike—through
a misty atmosphere of conjecture and
adulation; and about whom we feel some of the
fond solicitude expressed over and over again
by the letter-writers of this engaging period.</p>

<p>Translated into prose, the Sylph becomes
Mrs. Agmondesham Vesey,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Vesey, of verse the judge and friend,—</div>
</div></div>

<p>a fatuous deaf lady, with a taste for literary
society, and a talent for arranging chairs. She
it was who first gathered the “Blues” together,
placing them in little groups—generally
back to back—and flitting so rapidly
from one group to another, her ear-trumpet
hung around her neck, that she never heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
more than a few broken sentences of conversation.
She had what Miss Hannah More
amiably called “plastic genius,” which meant
that she fidgeted perpetually; and what Miss
Carter termed “a delightful spirit of innocent
irregularity,” which meant that she was inconsequent
to the danger point. “She united,” said
Madame d’Arblay, “the unguardedness of childhood
to a Hibernian bewilderment of ideas
which cast her incessantly into some burlesque
situation.” But her kind-heartedness (she proposed
having her drawing-room gravelled, so
that a lame friend could walk on it without
slipping) made even her absurdities lovable,
and her most fantastic behaviour was tolerated
as proof of her aerial essence. “There is nothing
of mere vulgar mortality about our
Sylph,” wrote Miss Carter proudly.</p>

<p>It was in accordance with this pleasing illusion
that, when Mrs. Vesey took a sea voyage,
her friends spoke of her as though she were a
mermaid, disporting herself in, instead of on,
the ocean. They not only held “the uproar of
a stormy sea to be as well adapted to the sublime
of her imagination as the soft murmur of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
a gliding stream to the gentleness of her temper”
(so much might at a pinch be said about
any of us); but we find Miss Carter writing
to Mrs. Montagu in this perplexing strain:—</p>

<p>“I fancy our Sylph has not yet left the
coral groves and submarine palaces in which
she would meet with so many of her fellow
nymphs on her way to England. I think if she
had landed, we should have had some information
about it, either from herself or from somebody
else who knows her consequence to us.”</p>

<p>The poor Sylph seems to have had rather a
hard time of it after the death of the Honourable
Agmondesham, who relished his wife’s
vagaries so little, or feared them so much, that
he left the bulk of his estate to his nephew, a
respectable young man with no unearthly qualities.
The heir, however, behaved generously
to his widowed aunt, giving her an income
large enough to permit her to live with comfort,
and to keep her coach. Miss Carter was
decidedly of the opinion that Mr. Vesey made
such a “detestable” will because he was lacking
in sound religious principles, and she expressed
in plain terms her displeasure with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
her friend for mourning persistently over the
loss of one who “so little deserved her tears.”
But the Sylph, lonely, middle-aged, and deaf,
realized perhaps that her little day was over.
Mrs. Montagu’s profuse hospitality had supplanted
“the biscuit’s ample sacrifice.” People
no longer cared to sit back to back, talking
platitudes through long and hungry evenings.
The “innocent irregularity” deepened into
melancholy, into madness; and the Sylph, a
piteous mockery of her old sweet foolish self,
faded away, dissolving like Niobe in tears.</p>

<p>It may be noted that the mission of the
literary lady throughout all these happy years
was to elevate and refine. Her attitude towards
matters of the intellect was one of obtrusive
humility. It is recorded that “an accomplished
and elegant female writer” (the name, alas!
withheld) requested Sir William Pepys to
mark all the passages in Madame de Staël’s
works which he considered “above her comprehension.”
Sir William “with ready wit”
declined this invidious task; but agreed to
mark all he deemed “worthy of her attention.”
We hardly know what to admire the most in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
a story like this;—the lady’s modesty, Sir
William’s tact, or the revelation it affords of infinite
leisure. When we remember the relentless
copiousness of Madame de Staël’s books,
we wonder if the amiable annotator lived long
enough to finish his task.</p>

<p>In matters of morality, however, the female
pen was held to be a bulwark of Great Britain.
The ambition to prove that—albeit a woman—one
may be on terms of literary intimacy
with the seven deadly sins (“Je ne suis qu’un
pauvre diable de perruquier, mais je ne crois
pas en Dieu plus que les autres”) had not yet
dawned upon the feminine horizon. The literary
lady accepted with enthusiasm the limitations
of her sex, and turned them to practical
account; she laid with them the foundations of
her fame. Mrs. Montagu, an astute woman of
the world, recognized in what we should now
call an enfeebling propriety her most valuable
asset. It sanctified her attack upon Voltaire,
it enabled her to snub Dr. Johnson, and it
made her, in the opinion of her friends, the
natural and worthy opponent of Lord Chesterfield.
She was entreated to come to the rescue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
of British morality by denouncing that nobleman’s
“profligate” letters; and we find the Rev.
Montagu Pennington lamenting years afterwards
her refusal “to apply her wit and genius
to counteract the mischief which Lord Chesterfield’s
volumes had done.”</p>

<p>Miss Hannah More’s dazzling renown rested
on the same solid support. She was so strong
morally that to have cavilled at her intellectual
feebleness would have been deemed profane.
Her advice (she spent the best part of eighty-eight
years in offering it) was so estimable that
its general inadequacy was never ascertained.
Rich people begged her to advise the poor.
Great people begged her to advise the humble.
Satisfied people begged her to advise the discontented.
Sir William Pepys wrote to her in
1792, imploring her to avert from England the
threatened dangers of radicalism and a division
of land by writing a dialogue “between two
persons of the lowest order,” in which should
be set forth the discomforts of land ownership,
and the advantages of labouring for small
wages at trades. This simple and childlike
scheme would, in Sir William’s opinion, go far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
towards making English workmen contented
with their lot, and might eventually save the
country from the terrible bloodshed of France.
Was ever higher tribute paid to sustained and
triumphant propriety? Look at Mary Wollstonecraft
vindicating the rights of woman in
sordid poverty, in tears and shame; and look
at Hannah More, an object of pious pilgrimage
at Cowslip Green. Her sisters were awestruck
at finding themselves the guardians of such preëminence.
Miss Seward eloquently addressed
them as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent7">sweet satellites that gently bear</div>
<div class="verse">Your lesser radiance round this beamy star;</div>
</div></div>

<p>and, being the humblest sisters ever known,
they seemed to have liked the appellation.
They guarded their luminary from common
contact with mankind; they spoke of her as
“she” (like Mr. Rider Haggard’s heroine),
and they explained to visitors how good and
great she was, and what a condescension it
would be on her part to see them, when two
peeresses and a bishop had been turned away
the day before. “It is an exquisite pleasure,”
wrote Miss Carter enthusiastically, “to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
distinguished talents and sublime virtue placed
in such an advantageous situation”; and the
modern reader is reminded against his will of
the lively old actress who sighed out to the
painter Mulready her unavailing regrets over
a misspent life. “Ah, Mulready, if I had only
been virtuous, it would have been pounds and
pounds in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Harmonious virgins,” sneered Horace Walpole,
“whose thoughts and phrases are like their
gowns, old remnants cut and turned”; and it is
painful to know that in these ribald words he
is alluding to the Swan of Lichfield, and to the
“glowing daughter of Apollo,” Miss Helen
Maria Williams. The Swan probably never
did have her gowns cut and turned, for she
was a well-to-do lady with an income of four
hundred pounds; and she lived very grandly
in the bishop’s palace at Lichfield, where her
father (“an angel, but an ass,” according to
Coleridge) had been for many years a canon.
But Apollo having, after the fashion of gods,
bequeathed nothing to his glowing daughter
but the gift of song, Miss Williams might occasionally
have been glad of a gown to turn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Her juvenile poem “Edwin and Eltruda” enriched
her in fame only; but “Peru,” being
published by subscription (blessed days when
friends could be turned into subscribers!),
must have been fairly remunerative; and we
hear of its author in London giving “literary
breakfasts,” a popular but depressing form of
entertainment. If ever literature be “alien to
the natural man,” it is at the breakfast hour.
Miss Williams subsequently went to Paris, and
became an ardent revolutionist, greatly to the
distress of poor Miss Seward, whose enthusiasm
for the cause of freedom had suffered a decline,
and who kept imploring her friend to come
home. “Fly, my dear Helen, that land of carnage!”
she wrote beseechingly. But Helen
couldn’t fly, being then imprisoned by the ungrateful
revolutionists, who seemed unable, or
unwilling, to distinguish friends from foes. She
had moreover by that time allied herself to Mr.
John Hurford Stone, a gentleman of the strictest
religious views, but without moral prejudices,
who abandoned his lawful wife for Apollo’s
offspring, and who, as a consequence, preferred
living on the Continent. Therefore Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Williams fell forever from the bright circle of
literary stars; and Lady Morgan, who met her
years afterwards in Paris, had nothing more
interesting to record than that she had grown
“immensely fat,”—an unpoetic and unworthy
thing to do. “For when corpulence, which is a
gift of evil, cometh upon age, then are vanished
the days of romance and of stirring deeds.”</p>

<p>Yet sentiment, if not romance, clung illusively
to the literary lady, even when she
surrendered nothing to persuasion. Strange
shadowy stories of courtship are told with pathetic
simplicity. Miss Carter, “when she had
nearly attained the mature age of thirty,” was
wooed by a nameless gentleman of unexceptionable
character, whom “she was induced
eventually to refuse, in consequence of his
having written some verses, of the nature of
which she disapproved.” Whether these verses
were improper (perish the thought!) or merely
ill-advised, we shall never know; but as the rejected
suitor “expressed ever after a strong sense
of Miss Carter’s handsome behaviour to him,”
there seems to have been on his part something
perilously akin to acquiescence. “I wonder,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
says the wise Elizabeth Bennet, “who first discovered
the efficacy of poetry in driving away
love.” It is a pleasure to turn from such uncertainties
to the firm outlines and providential
issues of Miss Hannah More’s early attachment.
When the wealthy Mr. Turner, who had
wooed and won the lady, manifested an unworthy
reluctance to marry her, she consented
to receive, in lieu of his heart and hand, an income
of two hundred pounds a year, which
enabled her to give up teaching, and commence
author at the age of twenty-two. The
wedding day had been fixed, the wedding dress
was made, but the wedding bells were never
rung, and the couple—like the lovers in the
story-books—lived happily ever after. The only
measure of retaliation which Miss More permitted
herself was to send Mr. Turner a copy
of every book and of every tract she wrote;
while that gentleman was often heard to say,
when the tracts came thick and fast, that Providence
had overruled his desire to make so admirable
a lady his wife, because she was destined
for higher things.</p>

<p>It was reserved for the Lichfield Swan to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
work the miracle of miracles, and rob love of
inconstancy. She was but eighteen when she
inspired a passion “as fervent as it was lasting”
in the breast of Colonel Taylor, mentioned
by discreet biographers as Colonel T.
The young man being without income, Mr.
Seward, who was not altogether an ass, declined
the alliance; and when, four years later,
a timely inheritance permitted a renewal of the
suit, Miss Seward had wearied of her lover.
Colonel Taylor accordingly married another
young woman; but the remembrance of the
Swan, and an unfortunate habit he had acquired
of openly bewailing her loss, “clouded
with gloom the first years of their married
life.” The patient Mrs. Taylor became in time
so deeply interested in the object of her husband’s
devotion that she opened a correspondence
with Miss Seward,—who was the champion
letter-writer of England,—repeatedly
sought to make her acquaintance, and “with
melancholy enthusiasm was induced to invest
her with all the charms imagination could devise,
or which had been lavished upon her by
description.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>This state of affairs lasted thirty years, at
the end of which time Colonel Taylor formed
the desperate resolution of going to Lichfield,
and seeing his beloved one again. He went,
he handed the parlour-maid a prosaic card; and
while Miss Seward—a stoutish, middle-aged,
lame lady—was adjusting her cap and kerchief,
he strode into the hall, cast one impassioned
glance up the stairway, and rapidly left
the house. When asked by his wife why he
had not stayed, he answered solemnly: “The
gratification must have been followed by pain
and regret that would have punished the temerity
of the attempt. I had no sooner entered
the house than I became sensible of the perilous
state of my feelings, and fled with precipitation.”</p>

<p>And the Swan was fifty-two! Well may we
sigh over the days when the Literary Lady
not only was petted and praised, not only was
the bulwark of Church and State; but when
she accomplished the impossible, and kindled
in man’s inconstant heart an inextinguishable
flame.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CHILD</h2>
</div>



<p class="center">I was not initiated into any rudiments ’till near four years
of age.—<span class="smcap">John Evelyn.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> courage of mothers is proverbial. There
is no danger which they will not brave in behalf
of their offspring. But I have always
thought that, for sheer foolhardiness, no one
ever approached the English lady who asked
Dr. Johnson to read her young daughter’s
translation from Horace. He did read it, because
the gods provided no escape; and he told
his experience to Miss Reynolds, who said
soothingly, “And how was it, Sir?” “Why,
very well for a young Miss’s verses,” was the
contemptuous reply. “That is to say, as compared
with excellence, nothing; but very well
for the person who wrote them. I am vexed at
being shown verses in that manner.”</p>

<p>The fashion of focussing attention upon
children had not in Dr. Johnson’s day assumed
the fell proportions which, a few years later,
practically extinguished childhood. It is true
that he objected to Mr. Bennet Langton’s connubial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
felicity, because the children were “too
much about”; and that he betrayed an unworthy
impatience when the ten little Langtons
recited fables, or said their alphabets in Hebrew
for his delectation. It is true also that he answered
with pardonable rudeness when asked
what was the best way to begin a little boy’s
education. He said it mattered no more how
it was begun, that is, what the child was
taught first, than it mattered which of his little
legs he first thrust into his breeches,—a callous
speech, painful to parents’ ears. Dr.
Johnson had been dead four years when Mrs.
Hartley, daughter of Dr. David Hartley of
Bath, wrote to Sir William Pepys:—</p>

<p>“Education is the rage of the times. Everybody
tries to make their children more wonderful
than any children of their acquaintance.
The poor little things are so crammed with
knowledge that there is scant time for them to
obtain by exercise, and play, and <i>vacancy of
mind</i>, that strength of body which is much
more necessary in childhood than learning.”</p>

<p>I am glad this letter went to Sir William,
who was himself determined that his children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
should not, at any rate, be less wonderful than
other people’s bantlings. When his eldest son
had reached the mature age of six, we find him
writing to Miss Hannah More and Mrs. Chapone,
asking what books he shall give the poor
infant to read, and explaining to these august
ladies his own theories of education. Mrs.
Chapone, with an enthusiasm worthy of Mrs.
Blimber, replies that she sympathizes with the
rare delight it must be to him to teach little
William Latin; and that she feels jealous for
the younger children, who, being yet in the
nursery, are denied their brother’s privileges.
When the boy is ten, Sir William reads to him
“The Faerie Queene,” and finds that he grasps
“the beauty of the description and the force
of the allegory.” At eleven he has “an animated
relish for Ovid and Virgil.” And the
more the happy father has to tell about the
precocity of his child, the more Mrs. Chapone
stimulates and confounds him with tales of
other children’s prowess. When she hears that
the “sweet Boy” is to be introduced, at five,
to the English classics, she writes at once about
a little girl, who, when “rather younger than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
he is” (the bitterness of that!), “had several
parts of Milton by heart.” These “she understood
so well as to apply to her Mother the
speech of the Elder Brother in ‘Comus,’ when
she saw her uneasy for want of a letter from
the Dean; and began of her own accord with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘Peace, Mother, be not over exquisite</div>
<div class="verse">To cast the fashion of uncertain evils’”;—</div>
</div></div>

<p>advice which would have exasperated a normal
parent to the boxing point.</p>

<p>There were few normal parents left, however,
at this period, to stem the tide of infantile
precocity. Child-study was dawning as a new
and fascinating pursuit upon the English world;
and the babes of Britain responded nobly to
the demands made upon their incapacity. Miss
Anna Seward lisped Milton at three, “recited
poetical passages, with eyes brimming with delight,”
at five, and versified her favourite psalms
at nine. Her father, who viewed these alarming
symptoms with delight, was so ill-advised as to
offer her, when she was ten, a whole half-crown,
if she would write a poem on Spring; whereupon
she “swiftly penned” twenty-five lines, which
have been preserved to an ungrateful world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and which shadow forth the painful prolixity of
future days. At four years of age, little Hannah
More was already composing verses with ominous
ease. At five, she “struck mute” the
respected clergyman of the parish by her exhaustive
knowledge of the catechism. At eight,
we are told her talents “were of such a manifestly
superior order that her father did not
scruple to combine with the study of Latin
some elementary instruction in mathematics;
a fact which her readers might very naturally
infer from the clear and logical cast of her
argumentative writings.”</p>

<p>It is not altogether easy to trace the connection
between Miss More’s early sums and her
argumentative writings; but, as an illustration
of her logical mind, I may venture to quote a
“characteristic” anecdote, reverently told by
her biographer, Mr. Thompson. A young lady,
whose sketches showed an unusual degree of
talent, was visiting in Bristol; and her work
was warmly admired by Miss Mary, Miss Sally,
Miss Elizabeth, and Miss Patty More. Hannah
alone withheld all word of commendation, sitting
in stony silence whenever the drawings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
were produced; until one day she found the
artist hard at work, putting a new binding on
a petticoat. <i>Then</i>, “fixing her brilliant eyes
with an expression of entire approbation upon
the girl, she said: ‘Now, my dear, that I find you
can employ yourself usefully, I will no longer
forbear to express my admiration of your drawings.’”</p>

<p>Only an early familiarity with the multiplication
table could have made so ruthless a
logician.</p>

<p>If Dr. Johnson, being childless, found other
people’s children in his way, how fared the
bachelors and spinsters who, as time went on,
were confronted by a host of infant prodigies;
who heard little Anna Letitia Aikin—afterwards
Mrs. Barbauld—read “as well as most
women” at two and a half years of age; and
little Anna Maria Porter declaim Shakespeare
“with precision of emphasis and firmness of
voice” at five; and little Alphonso Hayley recite
a Greek ode at six. We wonder if anybody
ever went twice to homes that harboured childhood;
and we sympathize with Miss Ferrier’s
bitterness of soul, when she describes a family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
dinner at which Eliza’s sampler and Alexander’s
copy-book are handed round to the
guests, and Anthony stands up and repeats
“My name is Norval” from beginning to end,
and William Pitt is prevailed upon to sing the
whole of “God save the King.” It was also a
pleasant fashion of the time to write eulogies
on one’s kith and kin. Sisters celebrated their
brothers’ talents in affectionate verse, and fathers
confided to the world what marvellous
children they had. Even Dr. Burney, a man
of sense, poetizes thus on his daughter Susan:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Nor did her intellectual powers require</div>
<div class="verse">The usual aid of labour to inspire</div>
<div class="verse">Her soul with prudence, wisdom, and a taste</div>
<div class="verse">Unerring in refinement, sound and chaste.</div>
</div></div>

<p>This was fortunate for Susan, as most young
people of the period were compelled to labour
hard. There was a ghastly pretence on the part
of parents that children loved their tasks, and
that to keep them employed was to keep them
happy. Sir William Pepys persuaded himself
without much difficulty that little William, who
had weak eyes and nervous headaches, relished
Ovid and Virgil. A wonderful and terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
letter written in 1786 by the Baroness de Bode,
an Englishwoman married to a German and
living at Deux-Ponts, lays bare the process by
which ordinary children were converted into
the required miracles of precocity. Her eldest
boys, aged eight and nine, appear to have been
the principal victims. The business of their
tutor was to see that they were “fully employed,”
and this is an account of their day.</p>

<p>“In their walks he [the tutor] teaches them
natural history and botany, not dryly as a task,
but practically, which amuses them very much.
In their hours of study come drawing, writing,
reading, and summing. Their lesson in writing
consists of a theme which they are to translate
into three languages, and sometimes into
Latin, for they learn that a little also. The
boys learn Latin as a recreation, and not as a
task, as is the custom in England. Perhaps <i>one
or two hours a day</i> is at most all that is given
to that study. ’Tis certainly not so dry a study,
when learnt like modern languages. We have
bought them the whole of the Classical Authors,
so that they can instruct themselves if they
will; between ninety and a hundred volumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
in large octavo. You would be surprised,—even
Charles Auguste, who is only five, reads
German well, and French tolerably. They all
write very good hands, both in Roman and
German texts. Clem and Harry shall write you
a letter in English, and send you a specimen
of their drawing. Harry (the second) writes
musick, too. He is a charming boy, improves
very much in all his studies, plays very prettily
indeed upon the harpsichord, and plays, too, all
tunes by ear. Clem will, I think, play well on the
violin; but ’tis more difficult in the beginning
than the harpsichord. He is at this moment
taking his lesson, the master accompanying him
on the pianoforte; and when Henry plays that,
the master accompanies on the violin, which
forms them both, and pleases them at the same
time. In the evening their tutor generally recounts
to them very minutely some anecdote
from history, which imprints it on the memory,
amuses them, and hurts no eyes.”</p>

<p>There is nothing like it on record except the
rule of life which Frederick William the First
drew up for little Prince Fritz, when that unfortunate
child was nine years old, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
disposed of his day, hour by hour, and minute
by minute. But then Frederick William—a
truth-teller if a tyrant—made no idle pretence
of pleasing and amusing his son. The unpardonable
thing about the Baroness de Bode is her
smiling assurance that one or two hours of
Latin a day afforded a pleasant pastime for
children of eight and nine.</p>

<p>This was, however, the accepted theory of
education. It is faithfully reflected in all the
letters and literature of the time. When Miss
More’s redoubtable “Cœlebs” asks Lucilla
Stanley’s little sister why she is crowned with
woodbine, the child replies: “Oh, sir, it is because
it is my birthday. I am eight years old
to-day. I gave up all my gilt books with pictures
this day twelvemonth; and to-day I give
up all my story-books, and I am now going
to read such books as men and women read.”
Whereupon the little girl’s father—that model
father whose wisdom flowers into many chapters
of counsel—explains that he makes the
renouncing of baby books a kind of epoch in
his daughters’ lives; and that by thus distinctly
marking the period, he wards off any return to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the immature pleasures of childhood. “We have
in our domestic plan several of these artificial
divisions of life. These little celebrations are
eras that we use as marking-posts from which
we set out on some new course.”</p>

<p>Yet the “gilt books,” so ruthlessly discarded
at eight years of age, were not all of an infantile
character. For half a century these famous
little volumes, bound in Dutch gilt paper—whence
their name—found their way into
every English nursery, and provided amusement
and instruction for every English child.
They varied from the “histories” of Goody
Two-Shoes and Miss Sally Spellwell to the
“histories” of Tom Jones and Clarissa Harlowe,
“abridged for the amusement of youth”;
and from “The Seven Champions of Christendom”
to “The First Principles of Religion,
and the Existence of a Deity; Explained in a
Series of Conversations, Adapted to the Capacity
of the Infant Mind.” The capacity of the
infant mind at the close of the eighteenth century
must have been something very different
from the capacity of the infant mind to-day.
In a gilt-book dialogue (1792) I find a father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
asking his tiny son: “Dick, have you got ten
lines of Ovid by heart?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Papa, and I’ve wrote my exercise.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, you shall ride with me.
The boy who does a little at seven years old,
will do a great deal when he is fourteen.”</p>

<p>This was poor encouragement for Dick, who
had already tasted the sweets of application. It
was better worth while for Miss Sally Spellwell
to reach the perfection which her name
implies, for <i>she</i> was adopted by a rich old lady
with a marriageable son,—“a young Gentleman
of such purity of Morals and good Understanding
as is not everywhere to be found.” In
the breast of this paragon “strange emotions
arise” at sight of the well-informed orphan;
his mother, who sets a proper value on orthography,
gives her full consent to their union;
and we are swept from the contemplation of
samplers and hornbooks to the triumphant conclusion:
“Miss Sally Spellwell now rides in her
coach and six.” Then follows the unmistakable
moral:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">If Virtue, Learning, Goodness are your Aim,</div>
<div class="verse">Each pretty Miss may hope to do the same;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>an anticipation which must have spurred many
a female child to diligence. There was no ill-advised
questioning of values in our great-grandmothers’
day to disturb this point of view.
As the excellent Mrs. West observed in her
“Letters to a young Lady,” a book sanctioned
by bishops, and dedicated to the Queen: “We
unquestionably were created to be the wedded
mates of man. Nature intended that man
should sue, and woman coyly yield.”</p>

<p>The most appalling thing about the precocious
young people of this period was the ease
with which they slipped into print. Publishers
were not then the adamantine race whose province
it is now to blight the hopes of youth.
They beamed with benevolence when the first
fruits of genius were confided to their hands.
Bishop Thirlwall’s first fruits, his “Primitiæ,”
were published when he was eleven years old,
with a preface telling the public what a wonderful
boy little Connop was;—how he studied
Latin at three, and read Greek with ease and
fluency at four, and wrote with distinction at
seven. It is true that the parent Thirlwall appears
to have paid the costs, to have launched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
his son’s “slender bark” upon seas which
proved to be stormless. It is true also that the
bishop suffered acutely in later years from this
youthful production, and destroyed every copy
he could find. But there was no proud and
wealthy father to back young Richard Polwhele,
who managed, when he was a schoolboy
in Cornwall, to get his first volume of verse
published anonymously. It was called “The
Fate of Llewellyn,” and was consistently bad,
though no worse, on the whole, than his maturer
efforts. The title-page stated modestly
that the writer was “a young gentleman of
Truro School”; whereupon an ill-disposed
critic in the “Monthly Review” intimated that
the master of Truro School would do well to
keep his young gentlemen out of print. Dr.
Cardew, the said master, retorted hotly that
the book had been published without his knowledge,
and evinced a lack of appreciation, which
makes us fear that his talented pupil had a bad
half-hour at his hands.</p>

<p>Miss Anna Maria Porter—she who delighted
“critical audiences” by reciting Shakespeare
at five—published her “Artless Tales”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
at fifteen; and Mrs. Hemans was younger still
when her “Blossoms of Spring” bloomed
sweetly upon English soil. Some of the “Blossoms”
had been written before she was ten.
The volume was a “fashionable quarto,” was
dedicated to that hardy annual, the Prince
Regent, and appears to have been read by
adults. It is recorded that an unkind notice
sent the little girl crying to bed; but as her
“England and Spain; or Valour and Patriotism”
was published nine months later, and
as at eighteen she “beamed forth with a
strength and brilliancy that must have shamed
her reviewer,” we cannot feel that her poetic
development was very seriously retarded.</p>

<p>And what of the marvellous children whose
subsequent histories have been lost to the
world? What of the two young prodigies of
Lichfield, “Aonian flowers of early beauty and
intelligence,” who startled Miss Seward and
her friends by their “shining poetic talents,”
and then lapsed into restful obscurity? What
of the wonderful little girl (ten years old)
whom Miss Burney saw at Tunbridge Wells;
who sang “like an angel,” conversed like “an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
informed, cultivated, and sagacious woman,”
played, danced, acted with all the grace of a
comédienne, wept tears of emotion without
disfiguring her pretty face, and, when asked
if she read the novels of the day (what a question!),
replied with a sigh: “But too often!
I wish I did not.” Miss Burney and Mrs.
Thrale were so impressed—as well they might
be—by this little Selina Birch, that they
speculated long and fondly upon the destiny
reserved for one who so easily eclipsed the
other miraculous children of this highly
miraculous age.</p>

<p>“Doubtful as it is whether we shall ever see
the sweet Syren again,” writes Miss Burney,
“nothing, as Mrs. Thrale said to her” (this,
too, was well advised), “can be more certain
than that we shall hear of her again, let her go
whither she will. Charmed as we all were, we
agreed that to have the care of her would be
distraction. ‘She seems the girl in the world,’
Mrs. Thrale wisely said, ‘to attain the highest
reach of human perfection as a man’s mistress.
As such she would be a second Cleopatra, and
have the world at her command.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Poor thing! I hope to Heaven she will
escape such sovereignty and such honours!”</p>

<p>She did escape scot-free. Whoever married—let
us hope he married—Miss Birch, was
no Mark Antony to draw fame to her feet.
His very name is unknown to the world. Perhaps,
as “Mrs.—Something—Rogers,” she
illustrated in her respectable middle age that
beneficent process by which Nature frustrates
the educator, and converts the infant Cleopatra
or the infant Hypatia into the rotund matron,
of whom she stands permanently in need.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE EDUCATOR</h2>
</div>



<p class="center">The Schoolmaster is abroad.—<span class="smcap">Lord Brougham.</span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is recorded that Boswell once said to Dr.
Johnson, “If you had had children, would you
have taught them anything?” and that Dr.
Johnson, out of the fulness of his wisdom, made
reply: “I hope that I should have willingly
lived on bread and water to obtain instruction
for them; but I would not have set their
future friendship to hazard for the sake of
thrusting into their heads knowledge of things
for which they might have neither taste nor
necessity. You teach your daughters the diameters
of the planets, and wonder, when you
have done it, that they do not delight in your
company.”</p>

<p>It is the irony of circumstance that Dr.
Johnson and Charles Lamb should have been
childless, for they were the two eminent Englishmen
who, for the best part of a century,
respected the independence of childhood. They
were the two eminent Englishmen who could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
have been trusted to let their children alone.
Lamb was nine years old when Dr. Johnson
died. He was twenty-seven when he hurled his
impotent anathemas at the heads of “the cursed
Barbauld crew,” “blights and blasts of all that
is human in man and child.” By that time the
educator’s hand lay heavy on schoolroom and
nursery. In France, Rousseau and Mme. de
Genlis had succeeded in interesting parents so
profoundly in their children that French babies
led a <i>vie de parade</i>. Their toilets and their
meals were as open to the public as were the
toilets and the meals of royalty. Their bassinettes
appeared in salons, and in private boxes
at the playhouse; and it was an inspiring sight
to behold a French mother fulfilling her sacred
office while she enjoyed the spectacle on the
stage. In England, the Edgeworths and Mr.
Day had projected a system of education which
isolated children from common currents of life,
placed them at variance with the accepted
usages of society, and denied them that wholesome
neglect which is an important factor in
self-development. The Edgeworthian child became
the pivot of the household, which revolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
warily around him, instructing him whenever
it had the ghost of a chance, and guarding him
from the four winds of heaven. He was not
permitted to remain ignorant upon any subject,
however remote from his requirements; but all
information came filtered through the parental
mind, so that the one thing he never knew was
the world of childish beliefs and happenings.
Intercourse with servants was prohibited; and
it is pleasant to record that Miss Edgeworth
found even Mrs. Barbauld a dangerous guide,
because little Charles of the “Early Lessons”
asks his nurse to dress him in the mornings.
Such a personal appeal, showing that Charles
was on speaking terms with the domestics, was
something which, in Miss Edgeworth’s opinion,
no child should ever read; and she praises the
solicitude of a mother who blotted out this, and
all similar passages, before confiding the book
to her infant son. He might—who knows?—have
been so far corrupted as to ask his own
nurse to button him up the next day.</p>

<p>Another parent, still more highly commended,
found something to erase in <i>all</i> her children’s
books; and Miss Edgeworth describes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
grave complacency this pathetic little library,
scored, blotted, and mutilated, before being
placed on the nursery shelves. The volumes
were, she admits, hopelessly disfigured; “but
shall the education of a family be sacrificed to
the beauty of a page? Few books can safely
be given to children without the previous use
of the pen, the pencil, and the scissors. These,
in their corrected state, have sometimes a few
words erased, sometimes half a page. Sometimes
many pages are cut out.”</p>

<p>Even now one feels a pang of pity for the
little children who, more than a hundred years
ago, were stopped midway in a story by the
absence of half a dozen pages. Even now one
wonders how much furtive curiosity was awakened
by this process of elimination. To hover
perpetually on the brink of the concealed and
the forbidden does not seem a wholesome situation;
and a careful perusal of that condemned
classic, “Bluebeard,” might have awakened
this excellent mother to the risks she ran.
There can be no heavier handicap to any child
than a superhumanly wise and watchful custodian,
whether the custody be parental, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
relegated to some phœnix of a tutor like Mr.
Barlow, or that cock-sure experimentalist who
mounts guard over “Émile,” teaching him with
elaborate artifice the simplest things of life.
We know how Tommy Merton fell from grace
when separated from Mr. Barlow; but what
<i>would</i> have become of Émile if “Jean Jacques”
had providentially broken his neck? What
would have become of little Caroline and Mary
in Mary Wollstonecraft’s “Original Stories,”
if Mrs. Mason—who is Mr. Barlow in petticoats—had
ceased for a short time “regulating
the affections and forming the minds” of
her helpless charges? All these young people
are so scrutinized, directed, and controlled,
that their personal responsibility has been
minimized to the danger point. In the name
of nature, in the name of democracy, in the
name of morality, they are pushed aside from
the blessed fellowship of childhood, and from
the beaten paths of life.</p>

<p>That Mary Wollstonecraft should have written
the most priggish little book of her day is
one of those pleasant ironies which relieves the
tenseness of our pity for her fate. Its publication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
is the only incident of her life which
permits the shadow of a smile; and even
here our amusement is tempered by sympathy
for the poor innocents who were compelled
to read the “Original Stories,” and to whom
even Blake’s charming illustrations must have
brought scant relief. The plan of the work is
one common to most juvenile fiction of the
period. Caroline and Mary, being motherless,
are placed under the care of Mrs. Mason, a
lady of obtrusive wisdom and goodness, who
shadows their infant lives, moralizes over every
insignificant episode, and praises herself with
honest assiduity. If Caroline is afraid of thunderstorms,
Mrs. Mason explains that <i>she</i> fears
no tempest, because “a mind is never truly
great until the love of virtue overcomes the
fear of death.” If Mary behaves rudely to a
visitor, Mrs. Mason contrasts her pupil’s conduct
with her own. “I have accustomed myself
to think of others, and what they will
suffer on all occasions,” she observes; “and
this loathness to offend, or even to hurt the
feelings of another, is an instantaneous spring
which actuates my conduct, and makes me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
kindly affected to everything that breathes....
Perhaps the greatest pleasure I have ever
received has arisen from the habitual exercise
of charity in its various branches.”</p>

<p>The stories with which this monitress illustrates
her precepts are drawn from the edifying
annals of the neighbourhood, which is rich
in examples of vice and virtue. On the one
hand we have the pious Mrs. Trueman, the
curate’s wife, who lives in a rose-covered cottage,
furnished with books and musical instruments;
and on the other, we have “the profligate
Lord Sly,” and Miss Jane Fretful, who
begins by kicking the furniture when she is in
a temper, and ends by alienating all her friends
(including her doctor), and dying unloved and
unlamented. How far her mother should be
held responsible for this excess of peevishness,
when she rashly married a gentleman named
Fretful, is not made clear; but all the characters
in the book live nobly, or ignobly, up
to their patronymics. When Mary neglects to
wash her face—apparently that was all she
ever washed—or brush her teeth in the mornings,
Mrs. Mason for some time only hints her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
displeasure, “not wishing to burden her with
precepts”; and waits for a “glaring example”
to show the little girl the unloveliness of permanent
dirt. This example is soon afforded
by Mrs. Dowdy, who comes opportunely to
visit them, and whose reluctance to perform
even the simple ablutions common to the period
is as resolute as Slovenly Peter’s.</p>

<p>In the matter of tuition, Mrs. Mason is
comparatively lenient. Caroline and Mary,
though warned that “idleness must always be
intolerable, because it is only an irksome consciousness
of existence” (words which happily
have no meaning for childhood), are, on the
whole, less saturated with knowledge than
Miss Edgeworth’s Harry and Lucy; and
Harry and Lucy lead rollicking lives by contrast
with “Edwin and Henry,” or “Anna
and Louisa,” or any other little pair of heroes
and heroines. Edwin and Henry are particularly
ill used, for they are supposed to be enjoying
a holiday with their father, “the worthy
Mr. Friendly,” who makes “every domestic
incident, the vegetable world, sickness and
death, a real source of instruction to his beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
offspring.” How glad those boys must
have been to get back to school! Yet they
court disaster by asking so many questions.
All the children in our great-grandmothers’
story-books ask questions. All lay themselves
open to attack. If they drink a cup of chocolate,
they want to know what it is made of,
and where cocoanuts grow. If they have a pudding
for dinner, they are far more eager to
learn about sago and the East Indies than to
eat it. They put intelligent queries concerning
the slave-trade, and make remarks that might
be quoted in Parliament; yet they are as ignorant
of the common things of life as though
new-born into the world. In a book called
“Summer Rambles, or Conversations Instructive
and Amusing, for the Use of Children,”
published in 1801, a little girl says to her
mother: “Vegetables? I do not know what
they are. Will you tell me?” And the mother
graciously responds: “Yes, with a great deal
of pleasure. Peas, beans, potatoes, carrots, turnips,
and cabbages are vegetables.”</p>

<p>At least the good lady’s information was
correct as far as it went, which was not always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the case. The talented governess in “Little
Truths” warns her pupils not to swallow
young frogs out of bravado, lest perchance
they should mistake and swallow a toad, which
would poison them; and in a “History of
Birds and Beasts,” intended for very young
children, we find, underneath a woodcut of a
porcupine, this unwarranted and irrelevant assertion:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">This creature shoots his pointed quills,</div>
<div class="indent">And beasts destroys, and men;</div>
<div class="verse">But more the ravenous lawyer kills</div>
<div class="indent">With his half-quill, the pen.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was thus that natural history was taught in
the year 1767.</p>

<p>The publication in 1798 of Mr. Edgeworth’s
“Practical Education” (Miss Edgeworth was
responsible for some of the chapters) gave a
profound impetus to child-study. Little boys
and girls were dragged from the obscure haven
of the nursery, from their hornbooks, and the
casual slappings of nursery-maids, to be taught
and tested in the light of day. The process appears
to have been deeply engrossing. Irregular
instruction, object lessons, and experimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
play afforded scant respite to parent or to child.
“Square and circular bits of wood, balls, cubes,
and triangles” were Mr. Edgeworth’s first
substitutes for toys; to be followed by “card,
pasteboard, substantial but not sharp-pointed
scissors, wire, gum, and wax.” It took an
active mother to superintend this home kindergarten,
to see that the baby did not poke the
triangle into its eye, and to relieve Tommy at
intervals from his coating of gum and wax.
When we read further that “children are very
fond of attempting experiments in dyeing, and
are very curious about vegetable dyes,” we
gain a fearful insight into parental pleasures
and responsibilities a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Text-book knowledge was frowned upon by
the Edgeworths. We know how the “good
French governess” laughs at her clever pupil
who has studied the “Tablet of Memory,” and
who can say when potatoes were first brought
into England, and when hair powder was first
used, and when the first white paper was made.
The new theory of education banished the
“Tablet of Memory,” and made it incumbent
upon parent or teacher to impart in conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
such facts concerning potatoes, powder,
and paper as she desired her pupils to know.
If books were used, they were of the deceptive
order, which purposed to be friendly and entertaining.
A London bookseller actually proposed
to Godwin “a delightful work for
children,” which was to be called “A Tour
through Papa’s House.” The object of this
precious volume was to explain casually how
and where Papa’s furniture was made, his carpets
were woven, his curtains dyed, his kitchen
pots and pans called into existence. Even Godwin,
who was not a bubbling fountain of humour,
saw the absurdity of such a book; and
recommended in its place “Robinson Crusoe,”
“if weeded of its Methodism” (alas! poor
Robinson!), “The Seven Champions of Christendom,”
and “The Arabian Nights.”</p>

<p>The one great obstacle in the educator’s
path (it has not yet been wholly levelled) was
the proper apportioning of knowledge between
boys and girls. It was hard to speed the male
child up the stony heights of erudition; but it
was harder still to check the female child at
the crucial point, and keep her tottering decorously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
behind her brother. In 1774 a few rash
innovators conceived the project of an advanced
school for girls; one that should approach from
afar a college standard, and teach with thoroughness
what it taught at all; one that might
be trusted to broaden the intelligence of
women, without lessening their much-prized
femininity. It was even proposed that Mrs.
Barbauld, who was esteemed a very learned
lady, should take charge of such an establishment;
but the plan met with no approbation
at her hands. In the first place she held that
fifteen was not an age for school-life and study,
because then “the empire of the passions is
coming on”; and in the second place there was
nothing she so strongly discountenanced as
thoroughness in a girl’s education. On this
point she had no doubts, and no reserves.
“Young ladies,” she wrote, “ought to have
only such a general tincture of knowledge as
to make them agreeable companions to a man
of sense, and to enable them to find rational
entertainment for a solitary hour. They should
gain these accomplishments in a quiet and unobserved
manner. The thefts of knowledge in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
our sex are connived at, only while carefully
concealed; and, if displayed, are punished with
disgrace. The best way for women to acquire
knowledge is from conversation with a father,
a brother, or a friend; and by such a course of
reading as they may recommend.”</p>

<p>There was no danger that an education conducted
on these lines would result in an undue
development of intelligence, would lift the
young lady above “her own mild and chastened
sphere.” In justice to Mrs. Barbauld we
must admit that she but echoed the sentiments
of her day. “Girls,” said Miss Hannah More,
“should be led to distrust their own judgments.”
They should be taught to give up their
opinions, and to avoid disputes, “even if they
know they are right.” The one fact impressed
upon the female child was her secondary place
in the scheme of creation; the one virtue she
was taught to affect was delicacy; the one vice
permitted to her weakness was dissimulation.
Even her play was not like her brother’s play,—a
reckless abandonment to high spirits; it
was play within the conscious limits of propriety.
In one of Mrs. Trimmer’s books, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
model mother hesitates to allow her eleven-year-old
daughter to climb three rounds of a
ladder, and look into a robin’s nest, four feet
from the ground. It was not a genteel thing
for a little girl to do. Even her schoolbooks
were not like her brother’s schoolbooks. They
were carefully adapted to her limitations. Mr.
Thomas Gisborne, who wrote a much-admired
work entitled “An Enquiry into the Duties of
the Female Sex,” was of the opinion that geography
might be taught to girls without reserve;
but that they should learn only “select
parts” of natural history, and, in the way of
science, only a few “popular and amusing
facts.” A “Young Lady’s Guide to Astronomy”
was something vastly different from the
comprehensive system imparted to her brother.</p>

<p>In a very able and subtle little book called
“A Father’s Legacy to his Daughters,” by Dr.
John Gregory of Edinburgh,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He whom each virtue fired, each grace refined,</div>
<div class="verse">Friend, teacher, pattern, darling of mankind!<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>—we find much earnest counsel on this subject.
Dr. Gregory was an affectionate parent. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
grudged his daughters no material and no intellectual
advantage; but he was well aware
that by too great liberality he imperilled their
worldly prospects. Therefore, although he desired
them to be well read and well informed,
he bade them never to betray their knowledge
to the world. Therefore, although he desired
them to be strong and vigorous,—to walk, to
ride, to live much in the open air,—he bade
them never to make a boast of their endurance.
Rude health, no less than scholarship,
was the exclusive prerogative of men. His
deliberate purpose was to make them rational
creatures, taking clear and temperate views of
life; but he warned them all the more earnestly
against the dangerous indulgence of
seeming wiser than their neighbours. “Be
even cautious in displaying your good sense,”
writes this astute and anxious father. “It will
be thought you assume a superiority over the
rest of your company. But if you happen to
have any learning, keep it a profound secret,
especially from men, who are apt to look with
a jealous and malignant eye on a woman of
great parts and cultivated understanding.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>This is plain speaking. And it must be remembered
that “learning” was not in 1774,
nor for many years afterwards, the comprehensive
word it is to-day. A young lady who
could translate a page of Cicero was held to
be learned to the point of pedantry. What
reader of “Cœlebs”—if “Cœlebs” still boasts
a reader—can forget that agitating moment
when, through the inadvertence of a child, it
is revealed to the breakfast table that Lucilla
Stanley studies Latin every morning with her
father. Overpowered by the intelligence, Cœlebs
casts “a timid eye” upon his mistress, who is
covered with confusion. She puts the sugar
into the cream jug, and the tea into the sugar
basin; and finally, unable to bear the mingled
awe and admiration awakened by this disclosure
of her scholarship, she slips out of the
room, followed by her younger sister, and commiserated
by her father, who knows what a
shock her native delicacy has received. Had
the fair Lucilla admitted herself to be an expert
tight-rope dancer, she could hardly have
created more consternation.</p>

<p>No wonder Dr. Gregory counselled his daughters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
to silence. Lovers less generous than
Cœlebs might well have been alienated by such
disqualifications. “Oh, how lovely is a maid’s
ignorance!” sighs Rousseau, contemplating
with rapture the many things that Sophie does
not know. “Happy the man who is destined
to teach her. She will never aspire to be the
tutor of her husband, but will be content to
remain his pupil. She will not endeavour to
mould his tastes, but will relinquish her own.
She will be more estimable to him than if she
were learned. It will be his pleasure to enlighten
her.”</p>

<p>This was a well-established point of view,
and English Sophies were trained to meet it
with becoming deference. They heard no idle
prating about an equality which has never
existed, and which never can exist. “Had a
third order been necessary,” said an eighteenth-century
schoolmistress to her pupils, “doubtless
one would have been created, a midway
kind of being.” In default of such a connecting
link, any impious attempt to bridge the
chasm between the sexes met with the failure
it deserved. When Mrs. Knowles, a Quaker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
lady, not destitute of self-esteem, observed to
Boswell that she hoped men and women would
be equal in another world, that gentleman replied
with spirit: “Madam, you are too ambitious.
<i>We</i> might as well desire to be equal
with the angels.”</p>

<p>The dissimulation which Dr. Gregory urged
upon his daughters, and which is the safeguard
of all misplaced intelligence, extended to
matters more vital than Latin and astronomy.
He warned them, as they valued their earthly
happiness, never to make a confidante of a
married woman, “especially if she lives happily
with her husband”; and never to reveal to
their own husbands the excess of their wifely
affection. “Do not discover to any man the
full extent of your love, no, not although you
marry him. <i>That</i> sufficiently shows your preference,
which is all he is entitled to know. If
he has delicacy, he will ask for no stronger
proof of your affection, for your sake; if he
has sense, he will not ask it, for his own. Violent
love cannot subsist, at least cannot be
expressed, for any time together on both sides.
Nature in this case has laid the reserve on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
you.” In the passivity of women, no less than
in their refined duplicity, did this acute observer
recognize the secret strength of sex.</p>

<p>A vastly different counsellor of youth was
Mrs. West, who wrote a volume of “Letters
to a Young Lady” (the young lady was Miss
Maunsell, and she died after reading them),
which were held to embody the soundest morality
of the day. Mrs. West is as dull as Dr.
Gregory is penetrating, as verbose as he is
laconic, as obvious as he is individual. She
devotes many agitated pages to theology, and
many more to irrefutable, though one hopes
unnecessary, arguments in behalf of female
virtue. But she also advises a careful submission,
a belittling insincerity, as woman’s best
safeguards in life. It is not only a wife’s duty
to tolerate her husband’s follies, but it is the
part of wisdom to conceal from him any knowledge
of his derelictions. Bad he may be; but
it is necessary to his comfort to believe that
his wife thinks him good. “The lordly nature
of man so strongly revolts from the suspicion
of inferiority,” explains this excellent monitress,
“that a susceptible husband can never feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
easy in the society of his wife when he knows
that she is acquainted with his vices, though
he is well assured that her prudence, generosity,
and affection will prevent her from being
a severe accuser.” One is reminded of the
old French gentleman who said he was aware
that he cheated at cards, but he disliked any
allusion to the subject.</p>

<p>To be “easy” in a wife’s society, to relax
spiritually as well as mentally, and to be immune
from criticism;—these were the privileges
which men demanded, and which well-trained
women were ready to accord. In 1808
the “Belle Assemblée” printed a model letter,
which purported to come from a young wife
whose husband had deserted her and her child
for the more lively society of his mistress. It
expressed in pathetic language the sentiments
then deemed correct,—sentiments which embodied
the patience of Griselda, without her
acquiescence in fate. The wife tells her husband
that she has retired to the country for economy,
and to avoid scandalous gossip; that by careful
management she is able to live on the pittance
he has given her; that “little Emily” is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
working a pair of ruffles for him; that his
presence would make their poor cottage seem
a palace. “Pardon my interrupting you,” she
winds up with ostentatious meekness. “I mean
to give you satisfaction. Though I am deeply
wronged by your error, I am not resentful. I
wish you all the happiness of which you are
capable, and am your once loved and still
affectionate, Emilia.”</p>

<p>That last sentence is not without dignity,
and certainly not without its sting. One doubts
whether Emilia’s husband, for all her promises
and protestations, could ever again have felt
perfectly “easy” in his wife’s society. He
probably therefore stayed away, and soothed
his soul elsewhere. “We can with tranquillity
forgive in ourselves the sins of which no one
accuses us.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PIETIST</h2>
</div>



<p class="center">They go the fairest way to Heaven that would serve God
without a Hell.—<i>Religio Medici.</i></p>



<p>“<span class="smcap">How</span> cutting it is to be the means of bringing
children into the world to be the subjects of
the Kingdom of Darkness, to dwell with Divils
and Damned Spirits.”</p>

<p>In this temper of pardonable regret the
mother of William Godwin wrote to her erring
son; and while the maternal point of view
deserves consideration (no parent could be
expected to relish such a prospect), the letter
is noteworthy as being one of the few written
to Godwin, or about Godwin, which forces us to
sympathize with the philosopher. The boy who
was reproved for picking up the family cat on
Sunday—“demeaning myself with such profaneness
on the Lord’s day”—was little likely
to find his religion “all pure profit.” His account
of the books he read as a child, and of
his precocious and unctuous piety, is probably
over-emphasized for the sake of colour; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Evangelical literature of his day, whether designed
for young people or for adults, was of
a melancholy and discouraging character. The
“Pious Deaths of Many Godly Children” (sad
monitor of the Godwin nursery) appears to
have been read off the face of the earth; but
there have descended to us sundry volumes of
a like character, which even now stab us with
pity for the little readers long since laid in
their graves. The most frivolous occupation of
the good boy in these old story-books is searching
the Bible, “with mamma’s permission,” for
texts in which David “praises God for the
weather.” More serious-minded children weep
floods of tears because they are “lost sinners.”
In a book of “Sermons for the Very Young,”
published by the Vicar of Walthamstow in the
beginning of the last century, we find the fall
of Sodom and Gomorrah selected as an appropriate
theme for infancy, and its lessons driven
home with all the force of a direct personal
application. “Think, little child, of the fearful
story. The wrath of God is upon them. Do
they now repent of their sins? It is all too
late. Do they cry for mercy? There is none to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
hear them.... Your heart, little child, is full
of sin. You think of what is not right, and
then you wish it, and that is sin.... Ah,
what shall sinners do when the last day comes
upon them? What will they think when God
shall punish them forever?”</p>

<p>Children brought up on these lines passed
swiftly from one form of hysteria to another,
from self-exaltation and the assurance of grace
to fears which had no easement. There is nothing
more terrible in literature than Borrow’s
account of the Welsh preacher who believed
that when he was a child of seven he had committed
the unpardonable sin, and whose whole
life was shadowed by fear. At the same time
that little William Godwin was composing
beautiful death-bed speeches for the possible
edification of his parents and neighbours, we
find Miss Elizabeth Carter writing to Mrs.
Montagu about her own nephew, who realized,
at seven years of age, how much he and all
creatures stood in need of pardon; and who,
being ill, pitifully entreated his father to pray
that his sins might be forgiven. Commenting
upon which incident, the reverent Montagu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Pennington, who edited Miss Carter’s letters,
bids us remember that it reflects more credit
on the parents who brought their child up with
so just a sense of religion than it does on the
poor infant himself. “Innocence,” says the inflexible
Mr. Stanley, in “Cœlebs in Search of
a Wife,” “can never be pleaded as a ground of
acceptance, because the thing does not exist.”</p>

<p>With the dawning of the nineteenth century
came the controversial novel; and to understand
its popularity we have but to glance at
the books which preceded it, and compared to
which it presented an animated and contentious
aspect. One must needs have read “Elements
of Morality” at ten, and “Strictures on Female
Education” at fifteen, to be able to relish
“Father Clement” at twenty. Sedate young
women, whose lightest available literature was
“Cœlebs,” or “Hints towards forming the
Character of a Princess,” and who had been
presented on successive birthdays with Mrs.
Chapone’s “Letters on the Improvement of the
Mind,” and Mrs. West’s “Letters to a Young
Lady,” and Miss Hamilton’s “Letters to the
Daughter of a Nobleman,” found a natural relief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in studying the dangers of dissent, or the
secret machinations of the Jesuits. Many a dull
hour was quickened into pleasurable apprehension
of Jesuitical intrigues, from the days when
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, stoutly refused
to take cinchona—a form of quinine—because
it was then known as Jesuit’s bark, and
might be trusted to poison a British constitution,
to the days when Sir William Pepys wrote
in all seriousness to Hannah More: “You surprise
me by saying that your good Archbishop
has been in danger from the Jesuits; but I believe
they are concealed in places where they
are less likely to be found than in Ireland.”</p>

<p>Just what they were going to do to the good
Archbishop does not appear, for Sir William
at this point abruptly abandons the prelate to
tell the story of a Norwich butcher, who for
some mysterious and unexplained reason was
hiding from the inquisitors of Lisbon. No dignitary
was too high, no orphan child too low to
be the objects of a Popish plot. Miss Carter
writes to Mrs. Montagu, in 1775, about a little
foundling whom Mrs. Chapone had placed at
service with some country neighbours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“She behaves very prettily, and with great
affection to the people with whom she is living,”
says Miss Carter. “One of the reasons she
assigns for her fondness is that they give her
enough food, which she represents as a deficient
article in the workhouse; and says that on Fridays
particularly she never had any dinner.
<i>Surely the parish officers have not made a
Papist the mistress!</i> If this is not the case,
the loss of one dinner in a week is of no great
consequence.”</p>

<p>To the poor hungry child it was probably of
much greater consequence than the theological
bias of the matron. Nor does a dinnerless Friday
appear the surest way to win youthful converts
to the fold. But devout ladies who had read
Canon Seward’s celebrated tract on the “Comparison
between Paganism and Popery” (in
which he found little to choose between them)
were well on their guard against the insidious
advances of Rome. “When I had no religion
at all,” confesses Cowper to Lady Hesketh, “I
had yet a terrible dread of the Pope.” The
worst to be apprehended from Methodists was
their lamentable tendency to enthusiasm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
their ill-advised meddling with the poor. It is
true that a farmer of Cheddar told Miss Patty
More that a Methodist minister had once
preached under his mother’s best apple tree, and
that the sensitive tree had never borne another
apple; but this was an extreme case. The Cheddar
vestry resolved to protect their orchards
from blight by stoning the next preacher who
invaded the parish, and their example was followed
with more or less fervour throughout
England. In a quiet letter written from Margate
(1768), by the Rev. John Lyon, we find this
casual allusion to the process:—</p>

<p>“We had a Methodist preacher hold forth
last night. I came home just as he had finished.
I believe the poor man fared badly, for I saw,
as I passed, eggs, stones, etc., fly pretty thick.”</p>

<p>It was all in the day’s work. The Rev. Lyon,
who was a scholar and an antiquarian, and who
wrote an exhaustive history of Dover, had no
further interest in matters obviously aloof from
his consideration.</p>

<p>This simple and robust treatment, so quieting
to the nerves of the practitioners, was unserviceable
for Papists, who did not preach in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
the open; and a great deal of suppressed irritation
found no better outlet than print. It
appears to have been a difficult matter in those
days to write upon any subject without reverting
sooner or later to the misdeeds of Rome.
Miss Seward pauses in her praise of Blair’s
sermons to lament the “boastful egotism” of
St. Gregory of Nazianzus, who seems tolerably
remote; and Mr. John Dyer, when wrapped
in peaceful contemplation of the British wool-market,
suddenly and fervently denounces the
“black clouds” of bigotry, and the “fiery bolts
of superstition,” which lay desolate “Papal
realms.” In vain Mr. Edgeworth, stooping from
his high estate, counselled serenity of mind, and
that calm tolerance born of a godlike certitude;
in vain he urged the benignant attitude of infallibility.
“The absurdities of Popery are so
manifest,” he wrote, “that to be hated they
need but to be seen. But for the peace and
prosperity of this country, the misguided Catholic
should not be rendered odious; he should
rather be pointed out as an object of compassion.
His ignorance should not be imputed to
him as a crime; nor should it be presupposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
that his life cannot be right, whose tenets are
erroneous. Thank God that I am a Protestant!
should be a mental thanksgiving, not a public
taunt.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edgeworth was nearly seventy when
the famous “Protestant’s Manual; or, Papacy
Unveiled” (endeared forever to our hearts by
its association with Mrs. Varden and Miggs),
bowled over these pleasant and peaceful arguments.
There was no mawkish charity about
the “Manual,” which made its way into every
corner of England, stood for twenty years on
thousands of British book-shelves, and was
given as a reward to children so unfortunate
as to be meritorious. It sold for a shilling (nine
shillings a dozen when purchased for distribution),
so Mrs. Varden’s two post-octavo volumes
must have been a special edition. Reviewers
recommended it earnestly to parents and teachers;
and it was deemed indispensable to all
who desired “to preserve the rising generation
from the wiles of Papacy and the snares of
priestcraft. They will be rendered sensible of
the evils and probable consequences of Catholic
emancipation; and be confirmed in those opinions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
civil, political, and religious, which have
hitherto constituted the happiness and formed
the strength of their native country.”</p>

<p>This was a strong appeal. A universal uneasiness
prevailed, manifesting itself in hostility
to innovations, however innocent and orthodox.
Miss Hannah More’s Sunday Schools were
stoutly opposed, as savouring of Methodism (a
religion she disliked), and of radicalism, for
which she had all the natural horror of a well-to-do,
middle-class Christian. Even Mrs. West,
an oppressively pious writer, misdoubted the
influence of Sunday Schools, for the simple
reason that it was difficult to keep the lower
orders from learning more than was good for
them. “Hard toil and humble diligence are
indispensably needful to the community,” said
this excellent lady. “Writing and accounts
appear superfluous instructions in the humblest
walks of life; and, when imparted to servants,
have the general effect of making them ambitious,
and disgusted with the servile offices
which they are required to perform.”</p>

<p>Humility was a virtue consecrated to the
poor, to the rural poor especially; and what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
with Methodism on the one hand, and the jarring
echoes of the French Revolution on the
other, the British ploughman was obviously
growing less humble every day. Crabbe, who
cherished no illusions, painted him in colours
grim enough to fill the reader with despair;
but Miss More entertained a feminine conviction
that Bibles and flannel waistcoats fulfilled
his earthly needs. In all her stories and tracts
the villagers are as artificial as the happy peasantry
of an old-fashioned opera. They group
themselves deferentially around the squire and
the rector; they wear costumes of uncompromising
rusticity; and they sing a chorus of
praise to the kind young ladies who have
brought them a bowl of soup. It is curious to
turn from this atmosphere of abasement, from
perpetual curtsies and the lowliest of lowly
virtues, to the journal of the painter Haydon,
who was a sincerely pious man, yet who cannot
restrain his wonder and admiration at seeing
the Duke of Wellington behave respectfully
in church. That a person so august should
stand when the congregation stood, and kneel
when the congregation knelt, seemed to Haydon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
an immense condescension. “Here was the
greatest hero in the world,” he writes ecstatically,
“who had conquered the greatest genius,
prostrating his heart and being before his God
in his venerable age, and praying for His
mercy.”</p>

<p>It is the most naïve impression on record.
That the Duke and the Duke’s scullion might
perchance stand equidistant from the Almighty
was an idea which failed to present itself to
Haydon’s ardent mind.</p>

<p>The pious fiction put forward in the interest
of dissent was more impressive, more emotional,
more belligerent, and, in some odd way, more
human than “Cœlebs,” or “The Shepherd of
Salisbury Plain.” Miss Grace Kennedy’s stories
are as absurd as Miss More’s, and—though
the thing may sound incredible—much duller;
but they give one an impression of painful
earnestness, and of that heavy atmosphere engendered
by too close a contemplation of Hell.
A pious Christian lady, with local standards, a
narrow intelligence, and a comprehensive ignorance
of life, is not by election a novelist. Neither
do polemics lend themselves with elasticity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
to the varying demands of fiction. There are,
in fact, few things less calculated to instruct
the intellect or to enlarge the heart than the
perusal of controversial novels.</p>

<p>But Miss Kennedy had at least the striking
quality of temerity. She was not afraid of being
ridiculous. She was undaunted in her ignorance.
And she was on fire with all the bitter
ardour of the separatist. Miss More, on the
contrary, entertained a judicial mistrust for
fervour, fanaticism, the rush of ardent hopes
and fears and transports, for all those vehement
emotions which are apt to be disconcerting
to ladies of settled views and incomes.
Her model Christian, Candidus, “avoids enthusiasm
as naturally as a wise man avoids
folly, or as a sober man shuns extravagance.
He laments when he encounters a real enthusiast,
because he knows that, even if honest, he
is pernicious.” In the same guarded spirit,
Mrs. Montagu praises the benevolence of Lady
Bab Montagu and Mrs. Scott, who had the
village girls taught plain sewing and the catechism.
“These good works are often performed
by the Methodist ladies in the heat of enthusiasm;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
but, thank God! my sister’s is a calm
and rational piety.” “Surtout point de zèle,”
was the dignified motto of the day.</p>

<p>There is none of this chill sobriety about
Miss Kennedy’s Bible Christians, who, a hundred
years ago, preached to a listening world.
They are aflame with a zeal which knows no
doubts and recognizes no forbearance. Their
methods are akin to those of the irrepressible
Miss J——, who undertook, Bible in hand,
the conversion of that pious gentleman, the
Duke of Wellington; or of Miss Lewis, who
went to Constantinople to convert that equally
pious gentleman, the Sultan. Miss Kennedy’s
heroes and heroines stand ready to convert the
world. They would delight in expounding the
Scriptures to the Pope and the Patriarch of
Constantinople. Controversy affords their only
conversation. Dogma of the most unrelenting
kind is their only food for thought. Piety provides
their only avenue for emotions. Elderly
bankers weep profusely over their beloved pastor’s
eloquence, and fashionable ladies melt into
tears at the inspiring sight of a village Sunday
School. Young gentlemen, when off on a holiday,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
take with them “no companion but a
Bible”; and the lowest reach of worldliness is
laid bare when an unconverted mother asks
her daughter if she can sing something more
cheerful than a hymn. Conformity to the
Church of England is denounced with unsparing
warmth; and the Church of Rome is honoured
by having a whole novel, the once famous
“Father Clement,” devoted to its permanent
downfall.</p>

<p>Dr. Greenhill, who has written a sympathetic
notice of Miss Kennedy in the “Dictionary
of National Biography,” considers that
“Father Clement” was composed “with an
evident wish to state fairly the doctrines and
practices of the Roman Catholic Church, even
while the authoress strongly disapproves of
them”;—a point of view which compels us
to believe that the biographer spared himself
(and who shall blame him?) the reading of this
melancholy tale. That George Eliot, who spared
herself nothing, was well acquainted with its
context, is evidenced by the conversation of
the ladies who, in “Janet’s Repentance,” meet
to cover and label the books of the Paddiford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
Lending Library. Miss Pratt, the autocrat of
the circle, observes that the story of “Father
Clement” is, in itself, a library on the errors
of Romanism, whereupon old Mrs. Linnet very
sensibly replies: “One ’ud think there didn’t
want much to drive people away from a religion
as makes ’em walk barefoot over stone
floors, like that girl in ‘Father Clement,’ sending
the blood up to the head frightful. Anybody
might see that was an unnat’ral creed.”</p>

<p>So they might; and a more unnatural creed
than Father Clement’s Catholicism was never
devised for the extinction of man’s flickering
reason. Only the mental debility of the Clarenham
family can account for their holding such
views long enough to admit of their being converted
from them by the Montagus. Only the
militant spirit of the Clarenham chaplain and
the Montagu chaplain makes possible several
hundred pages of polemics. Montagu Bibles
run the blockade, are discovered in the hands
of truth-seeking Clarenhams, and are hurled
back upon the spiritual assailants. The determination
of Father Dennis that the Scriptures
shall be quoted in Latin only (a practice which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
is scholarly but inconvenient), and the determination
of Edward Montagu “not to speak
Latin in the presence of ladies,” embarrass
social intercourse. Catherine Clarenham, the
young person who walks barefooted over stone
floors, has been so blighted by this pious exercise
that she cannot, at twenty, translate the
Pater Noster or Ave Maria into English, and
remains a melancholy illustration of Latinity.
When young Basil Clarenham shows symptoms
of yielding to Montagu arguments, and begins
to want a Bible of his own, he is spirited away
to Rome, and confined in a monastery of the
Inquisition, where he spends his time reading
“books forbidden by the Inquisitors,” and especially
“a New Testament with the prohibitory
mark of the Holy Office upon it,” which the
weak-minded monks have amiably placed at his
disposal. Indeed, the monastery library, to which
the captive is made kindly welcome, seems to
have been well stocked with interdicted literature;
and, after browsing in these pastures for
several tranquil months, Basil tells his astonished
hosts that their books have taught him
that “the Romish Church is the most corrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
of all churches professing Christianity.” Having
accomplished this unexpected but happy
result, the Inquisition exacts from him a solemn
vow that he will never reveal its secrets,
and sends him back to England, where he loses
no time in becoming an excellent Protestant.
His sister Maria follows his example (her virtues
have pointed steadfastly to this conclusion);
but Catherine enters a convent, full of
stone floors and idolatrous images, where she
becomes a “tool” of the Jesuits, and says her
prayers in Latin until she dies.</p>

<p>No wonder “Father Clement” went through
twelve editions, and made its authoress as famous
in her day as the authoress of “Elsie
Dinsmore” is in ours. No wonder the Paddiford
Lending Library revered its sterling worth.
And no wonder it provoked from Catholics reprisals
which Dr. Greenhill stigmatizes as “flippant.”
To-day it lives by virtue of half a dozen
mocking lines in George Eliot’s least-read story:
but for a hundred years its progeny has infested
the earth,—a crooked progeny, like Peer Gynt’s,
which can never be straightened into sincerity,
or softened into good-will. “For first the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of Rome condemneth us, we likewise them,” observes
Sir Thomas Browne with equanimity;
“and thus we go to Heaven against each others’
wills, conceits, and opinions.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE ACCURSED ANNUAL</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Why, by dabbling in those accursed Annuals, I have become
a by-word of infamy all over the kingdom.—<span class="smcap">Charles
Lamb.</span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great dividing line between books that
are made to be read and books that are made
to be bought is not the purely modern thing it
seems. We can trace it, if we try, back to the
first printing-presses, which catered indulgently
to hungry scholars and to noble patrons; and
we can see it in another generation separating
“Waverley” and “The Corsair,” which everybody
knew by heart, from the gorgeous “Annual”
(bound in Lord Palmerston’s cast-off
waistcoats, hinted Thackeray), which formed a
decorative feature of well-appointed English
drawing-rooms. The perfectly natural thing to
do with an unreadable book is to give it away;
and the publication, for more than a quarter of
a century, of volumes which fulfilled this one
purpose and no other is a pleasant proof, if
proof were needed, of the business principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
which underlay the enlightened activity of
publishers.</p>

<p>The wave of sentimentality which submerged
England when the clear-headed, hard-hearted
eighteenth century had done its appointed work,
and lay a-dying, the prodigious advance in gentility
from the days of Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu to the days of the Countess of Blessington,
found their natural expression in letters.
It was a period of emotions which were not too
deep for words, and of decorum which measured
goodness by conventionalities. Turn
where we will, we see a tear in every eye, or a
simper of self-complacency on every lip. Moore
wept when he beheld a balloon ascension at
Tivoli, because he had not seen a balloon since
he was a little boy. The excellent Mr. Hall
explained in his “Memories of a Long Life”
that, owing to Lady Blessington’s anomalous
position with Count D’Orsay, “Mrs. Hall never
accompanied me to her evenings, though she
was a frequent day caller.” Criticism was controlled
by politics, and sweetened by gallantry.
The Whig and Tory reviewers supported their
respective candidates to fame, and softened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
their masculine sternness to affability when
Mrs. Hemans or Miss Landon, “the Sappho
of the age,” contributed their glowing numbers
to the world. Miss Landon having breathed a
poetic sigh in the “Amulet” for 1832, a reviewer
in “Fraser’s” magnanimously observed:
“This gentle and fair young lady, so undeservedly
neglected by critics, we mean to take
under our special protection.” Could it ever
have lain within the power of any woman, even
a poetess, to merit such condescension as this?</p>

<p>Of a society so organized, the Christmas annual
was an appropriate and ornamental feature.
It was costly,—a guinea or a guinea
and a half being the usual subscription. It
was richly bound in crimson silk or pea-green
levant; Solomon in all his glory was less magnificent.
It was as free from stimulus as eau
sucrée. It was always genteel, and not infrequently
aristocratic,—having been known to
rise in happy years to the schoolboy verses of
a royal duke. It was made, like Peter Pindar’s
razors, to sell, and it was bought to be given
away; at which point its career of usefulness
was closed. Its languishing steel engravings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Corfu, Ayesha, The Suliote Mother, and The
Wounded Brigand, may have beguiled a few
heavy moments after dinner; and perhaps little
children in frilled pantalets and laced slippers
peeped between the gorgeous covers, to marvel
at the Sultana’s pearls, or ask in innocence who
was the dying Haidee. Death, we may remark,
was always a prominent feature of annuals.
Their artists and poets vied with one another
in the selection of mortuary subjects. Charles
Lamb was first “hooked into the ‘Gem’” with
some lines on the editor’s dead infant. From a
partial list, extending over a dozen years, I
cull this funeral wreath:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Dying Child. <i>Poem.</i><br />

The Orphans. <i>Steel engraving.</i><br />

The Orphan’s Tears. <i>Poem.</i><br />

The Gypsy’s Grave. <i>Steel engraving.</i><br />

The Lonely Grave. <i>Poem.</i><br />

On a Child’s Grave. <i>Poem.</i><br />

The Dying Mother to her Infant. <i>Poem.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Blithesome reading for the Christmas-tide!</p>

<p>The annual was as orthodox as it was aristocratic.
“The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain”
was not more edifying. “The Washerwoman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
of Finchley Common” was less conspicuously
virtuous. Here in “The Winter’s Wreath” is
a long poem in blank verse, by a nameless
clergyman, on “The Efficacy of Religion.”
Here in the “Amulet,” Mrs. Hemans, “leading
the way as she deserves to do” (I quote
from the “Monthly Review”), “clothes in her
own pure and fascinating language the invitations
which angels whisper into mortal ears.”
And here in the “Forget-Me-Not,” Leontine
hurls mild defiance at the spirit of doubt:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Thou sceptic of the hardened brow,</div>
<div class="indent">Attend to Nature’s cry!</div>
<div class="verse">Her sacred essence breathes the glow</div>
<div class="indent">O’er that thou wouldst deny;</div>
</div></div>

<p>—an argument which would have carried conviction
to Huxley’s soul, had he been more
than eight years old when it was written. Poor
Coleridge, always in need of a guinea or two,
was bidden to write some descriptive lines for
the “Keepsake,” on an engraving by Parris
of the Garden of Boccaccio; a delightful picture
of nine ladies and three gentlemen picnicking
in a park, with arcades as tall as aqueducts,
a fountain as vast as Niagara, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
butterflies twice the size of the rabbits. Coleridge,
exempt by nature from an unserviceable
sense of humour, executed this commission in
three pages of painstaking verse, and was
severely censured for mentioning “in terms
not sufficiently guarded, one of the most impure
and mischievous books that could find its
way into the hands of an innocent female.”</p>

<p>The system of first securing an illustration,
and then ordering a poem to match it, seemed
right and reasonable to the editor of the annual,
who paid a great deal for his engravings,
and little or nothing for his poetry. Sometimes
the poet was not even granted a sight of the
picture he was expected to describe. We find
Lady Blessington writing to Dr. William
Beattie,—the best-natured man of his day,—requesting
“three or four stanzas” for an annual
called “Buds and Blossoms,” which was
to contain portraits of the children of noble
families. The particular “buds” whose unfolding
he was asked to immortalize were the three
sons of the Duke of Buccleuch; and it was gently
hinted that “an allusion to the family would
add interest to the subject”;—in plain words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
that a little well-timed flattery might be trusted
to expand the sales. Another year the same
unblushing petitioner was even more hardy in
her demand.</p>

<p>“Will you write me a page of verse for the
portrait of Miss Forester? The young lady is
seated with a little dog on her lap, which she
looks at rather pensively. She is fair, with
light hair, and is in mourning.”</p>

<p>Here is an inspiration for a poet. A picture,
which he has not seen, of a young lady in
mourning looking pensively at a little dog!
And poor Beattie was never paid a cent for
these effusions. His sole rewards were a few
words of thanks, and Lady Blessington’s cards
for parties he was too ill to attend.</p>

<p>More business-like poets made a specialty of
fitting pictures with verses, as a tailor fits customers
with coats. A certain Mr. Harvey,
otherwise lost to fame, was held to be unrivalled
in this art. For many years his “chaste
and classic pen” supplied the annuals with
flowing stanzas, equally adapted to the timorous
taste of editors, and to the limitations of
the “innocent females” for whom the volumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
were predestined. “Mr. Harvey embodies in
two or three lines the expression of a whole
picture,” says an enthusiastic reviewer, “and at
the same time turns his inscription into a little
gem of poetry.” As a specimen gem, I quote
one of four verses accompanying an engraving
called Morning Dreams,—a young woman
reclining on a couch, and simpering vapidly at
the curtains:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
She has been dreaming, and her thoughts are still</div>
<div class="indent">On their far journey in the land of dreams;</div>
<div class="verse">The forms we call—but may not chase—at will,</div>
<div class="indent">And sweet low voices, soft as distant streams.</div>
</div></div>

<p>This is a fair sample of the verse supplied for
Christmas annuals, which, however “chaste
and classic,” was surely never intended to be
read. It is only right, however, to remember
that Thackeray’s “Piscator and Piscatrix”
was written at Lady Blessington’s behest, to
accompany Wattier’s engraving of The Happy
Anglers; and that Thackeray told Locker he
was so much pleased with this picture, and so
engrossed with his own poem, that he forgot to
shave for the two whole days he was working
at it. To write “good occasional verse,” by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
which he meant verse begged or ordered for
some such desperate emergency as Lady Blessington’s,
was, in his eyes, an intellectual feat.
It represented difficulties overcome, like those
wonderful old Italian frescoes fitted so harmoniously
into unaccommodating spaces. Nothing
can be more charming than “Piscator and Piscatrix,”
and nothing can be more insipid than
the engraving which inspired the lively rhymes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As on this pictured page I look,</div>
<div class="verse">This pretty tale of line and hook,</div>
<div class="verse">As though it were a novel-book,</div>
<div class="indent">Amuses and engages:</div>
<div class="verse">I know them both, the boy and girl,</div>
<div class="verse">She is the daughter of an Earl,</div>
<div class="verse">The lad (that has his hair in curl)</div>
<div class="indent">My lord the County’s page is.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A pleasant place for such a pair!</div>
<div class="verse">The fields lie basking in the glare;</div>
<div class="verse">No breath of wind the heavy air</div>
<div class="indent">Of lazy summer quickens.</div>
<div class="verse">Hard by you see the castle tall,</div>
<div class="verse">The village nestles round the wall,</div>
<div class="verse">As round about the hen, its small</div>
<div class="indent">Young progeny of chickens.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The verses may be read in any edition of
Thackeray’s ballads; but when we have hunted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
up the “pictured page” in a mouldy old “Keepsake,”
and see an expressionless girl, a featureless
boy, an indistinguishable castle, and no
village, we are tempted to agree with Charles
Lamb, who swore that he liked poems to explain
pictures, and not pictures to illustrate
poems. “Your woodcut is a rueful <i>lignum
mortis</i>.”</p>

<p>There was a not unnatural ambition on the
part of publishers and editors to secure for
their annuals one or two names of repute, with
which to leaven the mass of mediocrity. It
mattered little if the distinguished writer conscientiously
contributed the feeblest offspring
of his pen; that was a reasonable reckoning,—distinguished
writers do the same to-day; but
it mattered a great deal if, as too often happened,
he broke his word, and failed to contribute
anything. Then the unhappy editor
was compelled to publish some such apologetic
note as this, from the “Amulet” of 1833. “The
first sheet of the ‘Amulet’ was reserved for my
friend Mr. Bulwer, who had kindly tendered
me his assistance; but, in consequence of various
unavoidable circumstances” (a pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
trip on the Rhine), “he has been compelled to
postpone his aid until next year.” On such
occasions, the “reserved” pages were filled by
some veteran annualist, like Mr. Alaric Attila
Watts, editor of the “Literary Souvenir”;
or perhaps Mr. Thomas Haynes Bailey, he who
wrote “I’d be a Butterfly,” and “Gaily the
Troubadour,” was persuaded to warble some
such appropriate sentiment as this in the
“Forget-Me-Not”:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">It is a book we christen thus,</div>
<div class="indent">Less fleeting than the flower;</div>
<div class="verse">And ’twill recall the past to us</div>
<div class="indent">With talismanic power;</div>
</div></div>

<p>which was a true word spoken in rhyme. Nothing
recalls that faded past, with its simpering
sentimentality, its reposeful ethics, its shut-in
standards, and its differentiation of the masculine
and feminine intellects, like the yellow
pages of an annual.</p>

<p>Tom Moore, favourite of gods and men, was
singled out by publishers as the lode-star of
their destinies, as the poet who could be best
trusted to impart to the “Amethyst” or the
“Talisman” (how like Pullman cars they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
sound!) that “elegant lightness” which befitted
its mission in life. His accounts of the
repeated attacks made on his virtue, and the
repeated repulses he administered, fill by no
means the least amusing pages of his journal.
The first attempt was made by Orne, who, in
1826, proposed that Moore should edit a new
annual on the plan of the “Souvenir”; and
who assured the poet—always as deep in difficulties
as Micawber—that, if the enterprise
proved successful, it would yield him from five
hundred to a thousand pounds a year. Moore,
dazzled but not duped, declined the task; and
the following summer, the engraver Heath
made him a similar proposition, but on more
assured terms. Heath was then preparing to
launch upon the world of fashion his gorgeous
“Keepsake”—“the toy-shop of literature,”
Lockhart called it; and he offered Moore, first
five hundred, and then seven hundred pounds a
year, if he would accept the editorship. Seven
hundred pounds loomed large in the poet’s
fancy, but pride forbade the bargain. The
author of “Lalla Rookh” could not consent to
bow his laurelled head, and pilot the feeble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Fatimas and Zelicas, the noble infants in coral
necklets, and the still nobler ladies with pearl
pendants on their brows, into the safe harbour
of boudoir and drawing-room. He made this
clear to Heath, who, nothing daunted, set off
at once for Abbotsford, and laid his proposals
at the feet of Sir Walter Scott, adding to his
bribe another hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Scott, the last man in Christendom to have
undertaken such an office, or to have succeeded
in it, softened his refusal with a good-natured
promise to contribute to the “Keepsake” when
it was launched. He was not nervous about his
literary standing, and he had no sensitive fear
of lowering it by journeyman’s work. “I have
neither the right nor the wish,” he wrote once
to Murray, “to be considered above a common
labourer in the trenches.” Moore, however, was
far from sharing this modest unconcern. When
Reynolds, on whom the editorship of the
“Keepsake” finally devolved, asked him for
some verses, he peremptorily declined. Then
began a system of pursuit and escape, of assault
and repulse, which casts the temptations
of St. Anthony into the shade. “By day and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
night,” so Moore declares, Reynolds was “after”
him, always increasing the magnitude of his
bribe. At last he forced a check for a hundred
pounds into the poet’s empty pocket (for all
the world like a scene in Caran d’Ache’s “Histoire
d’un Chèque”), imploring in return a hundred
lines of verse. But Moore’s virtue—or
his vanity—was impregnable. “The task was
but light, and the money would have been convenient,”
he confesses; “but I forced it back
on him again. The fact is, it is my <i>name</i>
brings these offers, and my name would suffer
by accepting them.”</p>

<p>One might suppose that the baffled tempter
would now have permanently withdrawn, save
that the strength of tempters lies in their
never knowing when they are beaten. Three
years later, Heath renewed the attack, proposing
that Moore should furnish <i>all</i> the letter-press,
prose and verse, of the “Keepsake” for
1832, receiving in payment the generous sum
of one thousand pounds. Strange to say, Moore
took rather kindly to this appalling suggestion,
admitted he liked it better than its predecessors,
and consented to think the matter over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
for a fortnight. In the end, however, he adhered
to his original determination to hold himself
virgin of annuals; and refused the thousand
pounds, which would have paid all his debts,
only to fall, as fall men must, a victim to female
blandishments. He was cajoled into writing
some lines for the “Casket,” edited by Mrs.
Blencoe; and had afterwards the pleasure of
discovering that the astute lady had added
to her list of attractions another old poem
of his, which, to avoid sameness, she obligingly
credited to Lord Byron;—enough to
make that ill-used poet turn uneasily in his
grave.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb’s detestation of annuals dates
naturally enough from the hour he was first
seduced into becoming a contributor; and every
time he lapsed from virtue, his rage blazed out
afresh. When his ill-timed sympathy for a
bereaved parent—and that parent an editor—landed
him in the pages of the “Gem,”
he wrote to Barton in an access of ill-humour
which could find no phrases sharp enough to
feed it.</p>

<p>“I hate the paper, the type, the gloss, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
dandy plates, the names of contributors poked
up into your eyes in the first page, and whistled
through all the covers of magazines, the bare-faced
sort of emulation, the immodest candidateship,
brought into so little space; in short
I detest to appear in an annual.... Don’t
think I set up for being proud on this point; I
like a bit of flattery tickling my vanity as well
as any one. But these pompous masquerades
without masks (naked names or faces) I hate.
So there’s a bit of my mind.”</p>

<p>“Frippery,” “frumpery,” “show and emptiness,”
are the mildest epithets at Lamb’s command,
as often as he laments his repeated falls
from grace; and a few years before his death,
when that “dumb soporifical good-for-nothingness”
(curse of the Enfield lanes) weighted his
pen, and dulled the lively processes of his brain,
he writes with poignant melancholy:—</p>

<p>“I cannot scribble a long letter. I am, when
not on foot, very desolate, and take no interest
in anything, scarce hate anything but annuals.”
It is the last expression of a just antipathy, an
instinctive clinging to something which can be
reasonably hated to the end.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>The most pretentious and the most aristocratic
of the annuals was the ever famous “Book
of Beauty,” edited for many years by the Countess
of Blessington. Resting on a solid foundation
of personal vanity (a superstructure never
known to fail), it reached a heroic measure of
success, and yielded an income which permitted
the charming woman who conducted it to live
as far beyond her means as any leader of the
fashionable world in London. It was estimated
that Lady Blessington earned by the “gorgeous
inanities” she edited, and by the vapid tales
she wrote, an income of from two thousand to
three thousand pounds; but she would never
have been paid so well for her work had she
not supported her social position by an expenditure
of twice that sum. Charles Greville, who
spares no scorn he can heap upon her editorial
methods, declares that she attained her ends
“by puffing and stuffing, and untiring industry,
by practising on the vanity of some and
the good-nature of others. And though I never
met with any one who had read her books,
except the ‘Conversations with Byron,’ which
are too good to be hers, they are unquestionably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
a source of considerable profit, and she
takes her place confidently and complacently
as one of the literary celebrities of her day.”</p>

<p>Greville’s instinctive unkindness leaves him
often wide of the mark, but on this occasion
we can only say that he might have spoken his
truths more humanely. If Lady Blessington
helped to create the demand which she supplied,
if she turned her friendships to account,
and made of hospitality a means to an end (a
line of conduct not unknown to-day), she worked
with unsparing diligence, and with a sort of
desperate courage for over twenty years. Rival
Books of Beauty were launched upon a surfeited
market, but she maintained her precedence.
For ten years she edited the “Keepsake,”
and made it a source of revenue, until
the unhappy bankruptcy and death of Heath.
In her annuals we breathe the pure air of ducal
households, and consort with the peeresses of
England, turning condescendingly now and then
to contemplate a rusticity so obviously artificial,
it can be trusted never to offend. That her
standard of art (she had no standard of letters)
was acceptable to the British public is proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
by the rapturous praise of critics and reviewers.
Thackeray, indeed, professed to think the
sumptuous ladies, who loll and languish in the
pages of the year-book, underclad and indecorous;
but this was in the spirit of hypercriticism.
Hear rather how a writer in “Fraser’s
Magazine” describes in a voice trembling with
emotion the opulent charms of one of the
Countess of Blessington’s “Beauties”:—</p>

<p>“There leans the tall and imperial form of
the enchantress, with raven tresses surmounted
by the cachemire of sparkling red; while her
ringlets flow in exuberant waves over the full-formed
neck; and barbaric pearls, each one
worth a king’s ransom, rest in marvellous contrast
with her dark and mysterious loveliness.”</p>

<p>“Here’s richness!” to quote our friend Mr.
Squeers. Here’s something of which it is hard
to think a public could ever tire. Yet sixteen
years later, when the Countess of Blessington
died in poverty and exile, but full of courage
to the end, the “Examiner” tepidly observed
that the probable extinction of the year-book
“would be the least of the sad regrets attending
her loss.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>For between 1823 and 1850 three hundred
annuals had been published in England, and
the end was very near. Exhausted nature was
crying for release. It is terrible to find an able
and honest writer like Miss Mitford editing a
preposterous volume called the “Iris,” of inhuman
bulk and superhuman inanity; a book
which she well knew could never, under any
press of circumstances, be read by mortal man
or woman. There were annuals to meet every
demand, and to please every class of purchaser.
Comic annuals for those who hoped to laugh;
a “Botanic Annual” for girls who took country
walks with their governess; an “Oriental
Annual” for readers of Byron and Moore; a
“Landscape Annual” for lovers of nature;
“The Christian Keepsake” for ladies of serious
minds; and “The Protestant Annual” for
those who feared that Christianity might possibly
embrace the Romish Church. There were
five annuals for English children; from one of
which, “The Juvenile Keepsake,” I quote these
lines, so admirably adapted to the childish
mind. Newton is supposed to speak them in
his study:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Pure and ethereal essence, fairest light,</div>
<div class="verse">Come hither, and before my watchful eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Disclose thy hidden nature, and unbind</div>
<div class="verse">Thy mystic, fine-attenuated parts;</div>
<div class="verse">That so, intently marking, I the source</div>
<div class="verse">May learn of colours, Nature’s matchless gifts.</div>
</div></div>

<p>There are three pages of this poem, all in
the same simple language, from which it is fair
to infer that the child’s annual, like its grown-up
neighbour, was made to be bought, not read.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OUR ACCOMPLISHED GREAT-GRANDMOTHER</h2>
</div>



<p class="center">Next to mere idleness, I think knotting is to be reckoned
in the scale of insignificance.—<span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">Readers</span> of Dickens (which ought to mean all
men and women who have mastered the English
alphabet) will remember how that estimable
schoolmistress, Miss Monflathers, elucidated
Dr. Watts’s masterpiece, which had been
quoted somewhat rashly by a teacher. “‘The
little busy bee,’” said Miss Monflathers, drawing
herself up, “is applicable only to genteel
children.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In books, or work, or healthful play,</div>
</div></div>

<p>is quite right as far as they are concerned;
and the work means painting on velvet, fancy
needlework, or embroidery.”</p>

<p>It also meant, in the good Miss Monflathers’s
day, making filigree baskets that would
not hold anything, Ionic temples of Bristol-board,
shell flowers, and paper landscapes. It
meant pricking pictures with pins, taking “impressions”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
of butterflies’ wings on sheets of
gummed paper, and messing with strange, mysterious
compounds called diaphanie and potichomanie,
by means of which a harmless glass
tumbler or a respectable window-pane could be
turned into an object of desolation. Indeed,
when the genteel young ladies of this period
were not reading “Merit opposed to Fascination;
exemplified in the story of Eugenio,” or
“An Essay on the Refined Felicity which may
arise from the Marriage Contract,” they were
cultivating what were then called “ornamental
arts,” but which later on became known as
“accomplishments.” “It is amazing to me,”
says that most amiable of sub-heroes, Mr. Bingley,
“how young ladies can have patience to
be so very accomplished as they all are. They
paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I
scarcely know any one who cannot do all this;
and I am sure I never heard a young lady
spoken of for the first time, without being informed
that she was very accomplished.”</p>

<p>We leave the unamiable Mr. Darcy snorting
at his friend’s remark, to consider the
paucity of Mr. Bingley’s list. Tables, screens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
and purses represent but the first beginnings
of that misdirected energy which for the best
part of a century embellished English homes.
The truly accomplished young lady in Miss
More’s “Cœlebs” paints flowers and shells,
draws ruins, gilds and varnishes wood, is an
adept in Japan work, and stands ready to
begin modelling, etching, and engraving. The
great principle of ornamental art was the reproduction
of an object—of any object—in an
alien material. The less adapted this material
was to its purpose, the greater the difficulties
it presented to the artist, the more precious
became the monstrous masterpiece. To take a
plain sheet of paper and draw a design upon it
was ignominious in its simplicity; but to construct
the same design out of paper spirals,
rolling up some five hundred slips with uniform
tightness, setting them on end, side by side,
and painting or gilding the tops,—that was a
feat of which any young lady might be proud.
It was so uncommonly hard to do, it ought to
have been impossible. Cutting paper with fine
sharp scissors and a knife was taught in schools
(probably in Miss Monflathers’s school, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Dickens does not mention it) as a fashionable
pastime. The “white design”—animals, landscape,
or marine—was printed on a black
background, which was cut away with great
dexterity, the spaces being small and intricate.
When all the black paper had been removed,
the flimsy tracery was pasted on a piece of
coloured paper, thus presenting—after hours
of patient labour—much the same appearance
that it had in the beginning. It was then
glassed, framed, and presented to appreciative
parents, as a proof of their daughter’s industry
and taste.</p>

<p>The most famous work of art ever made out
of paper was probably the celebrated “herbal”
of Mrs. Delany,—Mrs. Delany whom Burke
pronounced “the model of an accomplished
gentlewoman.” She acquired her accomplishments
at an age when most people seek to relinquish
theirs,—having learned to draw when
she was thirty, to paint when she was forty,
and to write verse when she was eighty-two.
She also “excelled in embroidery and shell-work”;
and when Miss Burney made her first
visit to St. James’s Place, she found Mrs. Delany’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
walls covered with “ornaments of her
own execution of striking elegance, in cuttings
and variegated stained papers.” The herbal,
however, was the crowning achievement of her
life. It contained nearly a thousand plants,
made of thin strips of coloured paper, pasted
layer over layer with the utmost nicety upon
a black background, and producing an effect
“richer than painting.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Cold Winter views amid his realms of snow</div>
<div class="verse">Delany’s vegetable statues blow;</div>
<div class="verse">Smoothes his stern brow, delays his hoary wing,</div>
<div class="verse">And eyes with wonder all the blooms of Spring.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The flowers were copied accurately from nature,
and florists all over the kingdom vied with one
another in sending Mrs. Delany rare and beautiful
specimens. The Queen ardently admired
this herbal, and the King, who regarded it with
veneration not untinged by awe, expressed
his feelings by giving its creator a house at
Windsor, and settling upon her an annuity of
three hundred pounds. Yet Miss Seward complained
that although England “teemed with
genius,” George III was “no Cæsar Augustus,”
to encourage and patronize the arts. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the best of his ability, he did. His conception
of genius and art may not have tallied with
that of Augustus; but when an old lady made
paper flowers to perfection, he gave her a royal
reward.</p>

<p>Mrs. Delany’s example was followed in court
circles, and in the humbler walks of life. Shell-work,
which was one of her accomplishments,
became the rage. Her illustrious friend, the
Duchess of Portland, “made shell frames and
feather designs, adorned grottoes, and collected
endless objects in the animal and vegetable
kingdom.” Young ladies of taste made flowers
out of shells, dyeing the white ones with Brazil
wood, and varnishing them with gum arabic. A
rose of red shells, with a heart of knotted yellow
silk, was almost as much admired as a
picture of birds with their feathers pasted on
the paper. This last triumph of realism presented
a host of difficulties to the perpetrator.
When the bill and legs of the bird had been
painted in water colours on heavy Bristol-board,
the space for its body was covered with
a paste of gum arabic as thick as a shilling.
This paste was kept “tacky or clammy” to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
hold the feathers, which were stripped off the
poor little dead bird, and stuck on the prepared
surface, the quills being cut down with
a knife. Weights were used to keep the feathers
in place, the result being that most of them
adhered to the lead instead of to the Bristol-board,
and came off discouragingly when the
work was nearly done. As a combination of
art and nature, the bird picture had no rival
except the butterfly picture, where the clipped
wings of butterflies were laid between two
sheets of gummed paper, and the “impressions”
thus taken, reinforced with a little gilding,
were attached to a painted body. It may
be observed that the quality of mercy was then
a good deal strained. Mrs. Montagu’s famous
“feather-room,” in her house on Portman
Square, was ornamented with hangings made
by herself from the plumage of hundreds of
birds, every attainable variety being represented;
yet no one of her friends, not even
the sainted Hannah More, ever breathed a
sigh of regret over the merry little lives that
were wasted for its meretricious decorations.</p>

<p>Much time and ingenuity were devoted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
industrious young people to the making of
baskets, and no material, however unexpected,
came amiss to their patient hands. Allspice
berries, steeped in brandy to soften them and
strung on wire, were very popular; and rice baskets
had a chaste simplicity of their own. These
last were made of pasteboard, lined with silk
or paper, the grains of rice being gummed on
in solid diamond-shaped designs. If the decoration
appeared a trifle monotonous, as well it
might, it was diversified with coloured glass
beads. Indeed, we are assured that “baskets
of this description may be very elegantly ornamented
with groups of small shells, little artificial
bouquets, crystals, and the fine feathers
from the heads of birds of beautiful plumage”;—with
anything, in short, that could be pasted
on and persuaded to stick. When the supply of
glue gave out, wafer baskets—wafers required
only moistening—or alum baskets (made of
wire wrapped round with worsted, and steeped
in a solution of alum, which was coloured yellow
with saffron or purple with logwood) were held
in the highest estimation. The modern mind,
with its puny resources, is bewildered by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
multiplicity of materials which seem to have
lain scattered around the domestic hearth a hundred
years ago. There is a famous old receipt
for “silvering paper without silver,” a process
designed to be economical, but which requires
so many messy and alien ingredients,
like “Indian glue,” and “Muscovy talc,” and
“Venice turpentine,” and “Japan size,” and
“Chinese varnish,” that mere silver seems by
comparison a cheap and common thing. Young
ladies whose thrift equalled their ingenuity
made their own varnish by boiling isinglass in
a quart of brandy,—a lamentable waste of
supplies.</p>

<p>Genteel parcels were always wrapped in
silver paper. We remember how Miss Edgeworth’s
Rosamond tries in vain to make one
sheet cover the famous “filigree basket,” which
was her birthday present to her Cousin Bell,
and which pointed its own moral by falling to
pieces before it was presented. Rosamond’s
father derides this basket because he is implored
not to grasp it by its myrtle-wreathed
handle. “But what is the use of the handle,”
he asks, in the conclusive, irritating fashion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
the Edgeworthian parent, “if we are not to
take hold of it? And pray is this the thing
you have been about all week? I have seen
you dabbling with paste and rags, and could
not conceive what you were doing.”</p>

<p>Rosamond’s half-guinea—her godmother’s
gift—is spent buying filigree paper, and medallions,
and a “frost ground” for this basket,
and she is ruthlessly shamed by its unstable
character; whereas Laura, who gives her money
secretly to a little lace-maker, has her generosity
revealed at exactly the proper moment,
and is admired and praised by all the company.
Apart from Miss Edgeworth’s conception of
life, as made up of well-adjusted punishments
and rewards, a half-guinea does seem a good
deal to spend on filigree paper; but then a single
sheet of gold paper cost six shillings, unless
gilded at home, after the following process,
which was highly commended for economy:—</p>

<p>“Take yellow ochre, grind it with rain-water,
and lay a ground with it all over the paper,
which should be fine wove. When dry, take
the white of an egg and about a quarter of an
ounce of sugar candy, and beat them together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
until the sugar candy is dissolved. Then strike
it all over the ground with a varnish brush, and
immediately lay on the gold leaf, pressing it
down with a piece of fine cotton. When dry,
polish it with a dog’s tooth or agate. A sheet
of this paper may be prepared for eighteen
pence.”</p>

<p>No wonder little Rosamond was unequal to
such labour, and her half-guinea was squandered
in extravagant purchases. Miss Edgeworth,
trained in her father’s theory that children
should be always occupied, was a good deal
distressed by the fruits of their industry. The
“chatting girls cutting up silk and gold paper,”
whom Miss Austen watched with unconcern,
would have fretted Miss Edgeworth’s soul, unless
she knew that sensible needle-cases, pin-cushions,
and work-bags were in process of construction.
Yet the celebrated “rational toy-shop,”
with its hand-looms instead of dolls, and
its machines for drawing in perspective instead
of tin soldiers and Noah’s arks, stood responsible
for the inutilities she scorned. And what
of the charitable lady in “Lazy Lawrence,”
who is “making a grotto,” and buying shells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
and fossils for its decoration? Even a filigree
basket, which had at least the grace of impermanence,
seems desirable by comparison with
a grotto. It will be remembered also that
Madame de Rosier, the “Good French Governess,”
traces her lost son, that “promising
young man of fourteen,” by means of a box
he has made out of refuse bits of shell thrown
aside in a London restaurant; while the son
in turn discovers a faithful family servant
through the medium of a painted pasteboard dog,
which the equally ingenious domestic has exposed
for sale in a shop. It was a good thing in Miss
Edgeworth’s day to cultivate the “ornamental
arts,” were it only for the reunion of families.</p>

<p>Pasteboard, a most ungrateful and unyielding
material, was the basis of so many household
decorations that a little volume, published
in the beginning of the last century, is devoted
exclusively to its possibilities. This book, which
went through repeated editions, is called “The
Art of Working in Pasteboard upon Scientific
Principles”; and it gives minute directions for
making boxes, baskets, tea-trays, caddies,—even
candlesticks, and “an inkstand in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
shape of a castle with a tower,”—a baffling
architectural design. What patience and ingenuity
must have been expended upon this pasteboard
castle, which had a wing for the ink
well, a wing for the sand box, five circular
steps leading up to the principal entrance, a
terrace which was a drawer, a balcony surrounded
by a “crenelled screen,” a tower to
hold the quills, a vaulted cupola which lifted
like a lid, and a lantern with a “quadrilateral
pyramid” for its roof, surmounted by a real
pea or a glass bead as the final bit of decoration.
There is a drawing of this edifice, which
is as imposing as its dimensions will permit;
and there are four pages of mysterious instructions
which make the reader feel as though he
were studying architecture by correspondence.</p>

<p>Far more difficult of accomplishment, and
far more useless when accomplished,—for they
could not even hold pens and ink,—were the
Grecian temples and Gothic towers, made of
pasteboard covered with marbled paper, and
designed as “elegant ornaments for the mantelpiece.”
A small Ionic temple requires ten pages
of directions. It is built of “the best Bristol-board,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
except the shafts of the pillars and some
of the decorations, which are made of royal
drawing-paper”; and its manufacturers are
implored not to spare time, trouble, or material,
if they would attain to anything so classic.
“The art of working in pasteboard,” says the
preface of this engaging little book, “may be
carried to a high degree of usefulness and perfection,
and may eventually be productive of
substantial benefits to young persons of both
sexes, who wisely devote their leisure hours to
pleasing, quiet, and useful recreations, preferably
to frivolous, noisy, and expensive amusements.”</p>

<p>A pleasing, quiet, and useful recreation
which wasted nothing but eyesight,—and that
nobody valued,—was pricking pictures with
pins. The broad lines and heavy shadows were
pricked with stout pins, the fine lines and
high lights with little ones, while a toothed
wheel, sharply pointed, was used for large
spaces and simple decorative designs. This was
an ambitious field of art, much of the work
being of a microscopic delicacy. The folds of a
lady’s dress could be pricked in such film-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
waves that only close scrutiny revealed the
thousand tiny holes of which its billowy softness
was composed. The cleanness and dryness
of pins commend them to our taste after a
long contemplation of varnish and glue pots;
of “poonah work,” which was a sticky sort of
stencilling; of “Japan work,” in which embossed
figures were made of “gum-water, thickened
to a proper consistence with equal parts
of bole ammoniac and whiting”; of “Chinese
enamel,” which was a base imitation of ebony
inlaid with ivory; and of “potichomanie,”
which converted a piece of English glass into
something that “not one in a hundred could
tell from French china.” We sympathize with
the refined editor of the “Monthly Museum,”
who recommends knotting to his female readers,
not only because it had the sanction of a queen,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Who, when she rode in coach abroad,</div>
<div class="verse">Was always knotting threads;</div>
</div></div>

<p>but because of its “pure nature” and “innocent
simplicity.” “I cannot but think,” says
this true friend of my sex, “that shirts and
smocks are unfit for any lady of delicacy to
handle; but the shuttle is an easy flowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
object, to which the eye may remove with propriety
and grace.”</p>

<p>Grace was never overlooked in our great-grandmother’s
day, but took rank as an important
factor in education. A London schoolmistress,
offering in 1815 some advice as to
the music “best fitted for ladies,” confesses
that it is hard to decide between the “wide
range” of the pianoforte and the harp-player’s
“elegance of position,” which gives to her instrument
“no small powers of rivalry.” Sentiment
was interwoven with every accomplishment.
Tender mottoes, like those which Miss
Euphemia Dundas entreats Thaddeus of Warsaw
to design for her, were painted upon boxes
and hand-screens. Who can forget the white
leather “souvenir,” adorned with the words
“Toujours cher,” which Miss Euphemia presses
upon Thaddeus, and which that attractive but
virtuous exile is modestly reluctant to accept.
A velvet bracelet embroidered with forget-me-nots
symbolized friendship. A handkerchief,
designed as a gift from a young girl to her
betrothed, had a celestial sphere worked in one
corner, to indicate the purity of their flame;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
a bouquet of buds and blossoms in another, to
mark the pleasures and the brevity of life;
and, in a third, Cupid playing with a spaniel,
“as an emblem of the most passionate fidelity.”
Even samplers, which represented the first step
in the pursuit of accomplishments, had their
emblematic designs no less than their moral
axioms. The village schoolmistress, whom Miss
Mitford knew and loved, complained that all
her pupils wanted to work samplers instead of
learning to sew; and that all their mothers
valued these works of art more than they did
the neatest of caps and aprons. The sampler
stood for gentility as well as industry. It reflected
credit on the family as well as on the
child. At the bottom of a faded canvas, worked
more than a hundred years ago, and now hanging
in a great museum of art, is this inspiring
verse:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I have done this that you may see</div>
<div class="verse">What care my parents took of me.</div>
<div class="verse">And when I’m dead and in my grave,</div>
<div class="verse">This piece of work I trust you’ll save.</div>
</div></div>

<p>If the little girl who embodied her high
hopes in the painful precision of cross-stitch
could but know of their splendid fulfilment!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Modern</span> authors who object to being asked
for their autographs, and who complain piteously
of the persecutions they endure in this
regard, would do well to consider what they
have gained by being born in an age when
commercialism has supplanted compliment.
Had they been their own great-grandfathers,
they would have been expected to present to
their female friends the verses they now sell
to magazines. They would have written a few
playful and affectionate lines every time they
dined out, and have paid for a week’s hospitality
with sentimental tributes to their hostess.
And not their hostess only. Her budding
daughters would have looked for some recognition
of their charms, and her infant son
would have presented a theme too obvious for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
disregard. It is recorded that when Campbell
spent two days at the country seat of Mr.
James Craig, the Misses Craig kept him busy
most of that time composing verses for their
albums,—a pleasant way of entertaining a
poet guest. On another occasion he writes to
Mrs. Arkwright, lamenting, though with much
good-humour, the importunities of mothers.
“Mrs. Grahame has a plot upon me that I
should write a poem upon her boy, three years
old. Oh, such a boy! But in the way of writing
lines on lovely children, I am engaged
three deep, and dare not promise.”</p>

<p>It seems that parents not only petitioned for
these poetic windfalls, but pressed their claims
hard. Campbell, one of the most amiable of
men, yielded in time to this demand, as he had
yielded to many others, and sent to little Master
Grahame some verses of singular ineptitude.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sweet bud of life! thy future doom</div>

<div class="verse">And, fraught with love, that little brow</div>
<div class="indent">Shall wear the wreath of fame.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are many more stanzas, but these are
enough to make us wonder why parents did not
let the poet alone. Perhaps, if they had, he
would have volunteered his services. We know
that when young Fanny Kemble showed him
her nosegay at a ball, and asked how she should
keep the flowers from fading, he answered
hardily: “Give them to me, and I will immortalize
them,”—an enviable assurance of renown.</p>

<p>Album verses date from the old easy days,
when rhyming was regarded as a gentlemanly
accomplishment rather than as a means of livelihood.
Titled authors, poets wealthy and well-born—for
there were always such—naturally
addressed themselves to the ladies of their acquaintance.
They could say with Lord Chesterfield
that they thanked Heaven they did not
have to live by their brains. It was a theory,
long and fondly cherished, that poetry was not
common merchandise, to be bought and sold
like meal and malt; that it was, as Burns
admirably said, either above price or worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
nothing at all. Later on, when poets became
excellent men of business, when Byron had
been seduced by Murray’s generosity, when
Moore drove his wonderful bargains, and poetic
narrative was the best-selling commodity in the
market, we hear a rising murmur of protest
against the uncommercial exactions of the album.
Sonneteers who could sell their wares
for hard cash no longer felt repaid by a word
of flattery. Even the myrtle wreaths which
crowned the victors of the Bath Easton contests
appeared but slender compensation, save
in Miss Seward’s eyes, or in Mrs. Hayley’s.
When Mrs. Hayley went to Bath in 1781, and
witnessed the solemn ceremonies inaugurated
by Lady Miller; when she saw the laurels, and
myrtles, and fluttering ribbons, her soul was
fired with longing, and she set to work to persuade
her husband that the Bath Easton prize
was not wholly beneath his notice. The author
of “The Triumphs of Temper” was naturally
fearful of lowering his dignity by sporting with
minor poets; and there was much wifely artifice
in her assumption that such playfulness
on his part would be recognized as true condescension.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
“If you should feel disposed to
honour this slight amusement with a light composition,
I am persuaded you will oblige very
highly.” The responsive Hayley was not unwilling
to oblige, provided no one would suspect
him of being in earnest. He “scribbled”
the desired lines “in the most rapid manner,”
“literally in a morning and a half” (Byron
did not take much longer to write “The Corsair”),
and sent them off to Bath, where they
were “admired beyond description,” and won
the prize, so that the gratified Mrs. Hayley
appeared that night with the myrtle wreath
woven in her hair. The one famous contributor
to the Bath Easton vase who did <i>not</i> win
a prize was Sheridan. He, being entreated to
write for it some verses on “Charity,” complied
in these heartless lines:—</p>


<p class="center">THE VASE SPEAKS</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">For heaven’s sake bestow on me</div>
<div class="verse">A little wit, for that would be</div>
<div class="verse">Indeed an act of charity.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Complimentary addresses—those flowery
tributes which seem so ardent and so facile—were
beginning to drag a little, even in Walpole’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
day. He himself was an adept in the art
of polite adulation, and wrote without a blush
the obliging comparison between the Princess
Amelia and Venus (greatly to the disparagement
of Venus), which the flattered lady found
in the hand of the marble Apollo at Stowe.
“All women like all or any praise,” said Lord
Byron, who had reason to know the sex. The
Princess Amelia, stout, sixty, and “strong as
a Brunswick lion,” was pleased to be designated
as a “Nymph,” and to be told she had
routed Venus from the field. Walpole also
presented to Madame de Boufflers a “petite
gentillesse,” when she visited Strawberry Hill;
and it became the painful duty of the Duc de
Nivernois to translate these lines into French,
on the occasion of Miss Pelham’s grand fête at
Esher Place. The task kept him absorbed and
preoccupied most of the day, “lagging behind”
while the others made a cheerful tour of the
farms, or listened to the French horns and
hautboys on the lawn. Finally, when all the
guests were drinking tea and coffee in the Belvidere,
poor Nivernois was delivered of his
verselets, which were received with a polite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
semblance of gratification, and for the remaining
hours his spirit was at peace. But it does
seem a hard return to exact for hospitality, and
must often have suggested to men of letters
the felicity of staying at home.</p>

<p>Miss Seward made it her happy boast that
the number and the warmth of Mr. Hayley’s
tributes—inserted duly in her album—raised
her to a rivalry with Swift’s Stella, or Prior’s
Chloe. “Our four years’ correspondence has
been enriched with a galaxy of little poetic
gems of the first water.” Nor was the lady backward
in returning compliment for compliment.
That barter of praise, that exchange of felicitation,
which is both so polite and so profitable,
was as well understood by our sentimental ancestors
as it is in this hard-headed age. Indeed,
I am not sure that the Muse did not sometimes
calculate more closely then than she ventures
to do to-day. We know that Canon Seward
wrote an elegiac poem on a young nobleman
who was held to be dying, but who—perversely
enough—recovered; whereupon the
reverend eulogist changed the name, and transferred
his heartfelt lamentations to another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
youth whose death was fully assured. In the
same business-like spirit Miss Seward paid back
Mr. Hayley flattery for flattery, until even
the slow-witted satirists of the period made
merry over this commerce of applause.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Moore, as became a poet of ardent temperament,
wrote the most gallant album verses of
his day; for which reason, and because his star
of fame rode high, he endured sharp persecution
at the hands of admiring but covetous
friends. Young ladies asked him in the most
offhand manner to “address a poem” to
them; and women of rank smiled on him in
ballrooms, and confided to him that they were
keeping their albums virgin of verse until
“an introduction to Mr. Moore” should enable
them to request <i>him</i> to write on the opening
page. “I fight this off as well as I can,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
tells Lord Byron, who knew both the relentlessness
of such demands and the compliant
nature of his friend. On one occasion Lady
Holland showed Moore some stanzas which
Lord Holland had written in Latin and in
English, on the subject of a snuff-box given her
by Napoleon; bidding him imperiously “do
something of the kind,” and adding that she
greatly desired a corresponding tribute from
Lord Byron. Moore wisely declined to make
any promises for Byron (one doubts whether
the four lines which that nobleman eventually
contributed afforded her ladyship much
pleasure), but wrote his own verses before
he was out of bed the next morning, and
carried them to Holland House, expecting to
breakfast with its mistress. He found her,
however, in such a captious mood, so out of
temper with all her little world, that, although
he sat down to the table, he did not venture to
hint his hunger; and as no one asked him to
eat or drink, he slipped off in half an hour,
and sought (his poem still in his pocket) the
more genial hospitality of Rosset’s restaurant.
Had all this happened twenty years earlier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
Moore’s self-esteem would have been deeply
wounded; but the poet was by now a man of
mark, and could afford to laugh at his own
discomfiture.</p>

<p>Moore’s album verses may be said to make
up in warmth what they lack in address. Minor
poets—minims like William Robert Spencer—surpassed
him easily in adroitness; and
sometimes won for themselves slender but
abiding reputations by expressing with consummate
ease sentiments they did not feel.
Spencer’s pretty lines beginning,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Too late I stayed,—forgive the crime!</div>
<div class="indent">Unheeded flew the hours:</div>
<div class="verse">How noiseless falls the foot of time</div>
<div class="indent">That only treads on flowers!</div>
</div></div>

<p>—lines which all our grandmothers had by
heart—may still be found in compilations of
English verse. Their dexterous allusions to
the diamond sparks in Time’s hour-glass, and
to the bird-of-paradise plumage in his grey
wings, their veiled and graceful flattery, contrast
pleasantly with Moore’s Hibernian boldness,
with his offhand demand to be paid in
kisses for his songs—</p>

<p>A discreet young woman might have hesitated
to show <i>this</i> album page to friends.</p>

<p>Byron’s “tributes,” when he paid them, were
singularly chill. He may have buried his heart
at Mrs. Spencer Smith’s feet; but the lines in
her album which record this interment are
eloquent of a speedy resurrection. When Lady
Blessington demanded some verses, he wrote
them; but he explained with almost insulting
lucidity that his heart was as grey as his head
(he was thirty-one), and that he had nothing
warmer than friendship to offer in place of extinguished
affections. Moore must have wearied
painfully of albums and of their rapacious demands;
yet to the end of his life he could be
harassed into feigning a poetic passion; but
Byron stood at bay. He was a hunted creature,
and the instinct of self-preservation taught him
savage methods of escape.</p>

<p>There are people who, from some delicacy of
mental fibre, find it exceedingly difficult to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
rude; and there are people who—like Charles
Lamb—have a curious habit of doing what
they do not want to do, and what they know is
not worth doing, for the sake of giving pleasure
to some utterly insignificant acquaintance. The
first class lacks a valuable weapon in life’s warfare.
The second class is so small, and the
motives which govern it are so inscrutable, that
we are apt to be exasperated by its amiability.
It is easy to sympathize with Thackeray, who,
being badgered to write in an album already
graced by the signatures of several distinguished
musicians, said curtly: “What! among all those
fiddlers!” This hardy British superciliousness
commends itself to our sense of humour, no
less than to our sense of self-protection. A great
deal has been said, especially by Frenchmen,
about the wisdom of polite denials; but a rough
word, spoken in time, is seldom without weight
in England.</p>

<p>Yet, for a friend, Thackeray found no labour
hard. The genial tolerance of “The Pen and the
Album” suggests something akin to affection
for these pillaging little books when the right
people owned them,—when they belonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
“Chesham Place.” Locker tells a pleasant story
of meeting Thackeray in Pall Mall, on his way
to Kensington, and offering to join him in his
walk. This offer was declined, Thackeray explaining
that he had some rhymes trotting
through his head, and that he was trying to
polish them off in the course of a solitary stroll.
A few days later they met again, and Thackeray
said, “I finished those verses, and they are
very nearly being very good. I call them ‘Mrs.
Katherine’s Lantern.’ I did them for Dickens’s
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Very nearly being very good!” This is an
author’s modest estimate. Readers there are
who have found them so absolutely good that
they leaven the whole heavy mass of album
verse. Shall not a century of extortion on the
one side and debility on the other be forgiven,
because upon one blank page, the property of
one thrice fortunate young woman, were written
these lines, fragrant with imperishable sentiment:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When he was young as you are young,</div>
<div class="verse">When he was young, and lutes were strung,</div>
<div class="verse">And love-lamps in the casement hung.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>But when we turn to Lamb, and find him
driving his pen along its unwilling way, and
admitting ruefully that the road was hard, we
see the reverse of the medal, and we resent
that inexplicable sweetness of temper which
left him defenceless before marauders.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My feeble Muse, that fain her best would</div>
<div class="verse">Write at command of Frances Westwood,</div>
<div class="verse">But feels her wits not in their best mood.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Why should Frances Westwood have commanded
his services? Why should Frances
Brown, “engaged to a Mr. White,” have wrung
from him a dozen lines of what we should now
call “copy”? She had no recognizable right to
that copy; but Lamb confided to Mrs. Moxon
that he had sent it to her at twenty-four hours’
notice, because she was going to be married and
start with her husband for India. Also that he
had forgotten what he had written, save only
two lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="indent9">May your fame</div>
<div class="verse">And fortune, Frances, Whiten with your name!</div>
</div></div>

<p>of which conceit he was innocently proud.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moxon (Emma Isola) was herself an
old and hardened offender. Her album, enriched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
with the spoils of a predatory warfare, travelled
far afield, extorting its tribute of verse. We
find Lamb first paying, as was natural, his
own tithes, and then actually aiding and abetting
injustice by sending the book to Mr. Procter
(Barry Cornwall), with an irresistible
appeal for support.</p>

<p>“I have another favour to beg, which is the
beggarliest of beggings; a few lines of verse
for a young friend’s album (six will be enough).
M. Burney will tell you who I want ’em for.
A girl of gold. Six lines—make ’em eight—signed
Barry C——. They need not be very
good, as I chiefly want ’em as a foil to mine.
But I shall be seriously obliged by any refuse
scraps. We are in the last ages of the world,
when St. Paul prophesied that women should
be ‘headstrong lovers of their own wills, having
albums.’ I fled hither to escape the albumean
persecution, and had not been in my new house
twenty-four hours when a daughter of the next
house came in with a friend’s album, to beg a
contribution, and, the following day, intimated
she had one of her own. Two more have sprung
up since. ‘If I take the wings of the morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
and fly unto the uttermost parts of the earth,
there will albums be.’ New Holland has albums.
The age is to be complied with.”</p>

<p>“Ask for this little book a token of remembrance
from friends, and from fellow students,
and from wayfarers whom you may never see
again. He who gives you his name and a few
kind words, gives you a treasure which shall
keep his memory green.”</p>

<p>So wrote Goethe—out of the abyss of German
sentimentality—in his son’s album; and
the words have a pleasant ring of good fellowship
and unforced fraternity. They are akin to
those gracious phrases with which the French
monarchy—“despotism tempered by epigram”—was
wont to designate the taxes that devoured
the land. There was a charming politeness
in the assumption that taxes were free
gifts, gladly given; but those who gave them
knew.</p>
